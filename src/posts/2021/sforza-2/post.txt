## Death of husband #1

Girolamo promised the people of Forli' that he was not going to raise taxes. And they were like this guy seems alright!

But then Girolamo needed money to finance his decadent lifestyle, so he kinda raised taxes. And the Forlivesi didn't like it one bit. One day, a mob of angry people broke into the Sforza mansion, dragged Girolamo out on the streets and went all stabby-stabby on him.

## The famous scene on the ramparts

We actually have the whole scene thank you to the Animus technology.

But, come on, did it really happen? Well, the Orsis did menace to kill her sons, and Caterina did not accept the black mail, but the pussy scene? Didn't really happen.

We actually suspect that it was circulated by none other than:

Box

Niccolo' Machiavelli: the incel strategist

You see, Machiavelli hated Caterina with all his heart. In fact, he was once sent by the Medici to close a deal with her, and he thought this was going to be a walk in the park because, and I quote:

"She is a woman, after all. And women are only good horizontally and/or in the kitchen, lmao!"

Well, Caterina played with him a bit. Let him wait for hours, juggled his balls a bit and then sent him back to Florence with no brexit deal.

We def need a post about Machiavelli. Find the link here. (No link means it's not done yet, duh.)

Box End

In part 2, we will meet a new love for Caterina. Will they live happily ever after? Spoiler: no.



In part 1, we got acquainted with Caterina Sforza, her late husband, and her home in Forli'. Then her husband died, which was for the best, really.

## A new love

## The castellan cancellation

## Death of husband #2



A beautiful status of Giacomo was erected. Unfortunately, it was destroyed during WWII. Thank you, Hitler ðŸ˜¡.

In part 3, we will meet a new love for Caterina. Will they live happily ever after? Spoiler: no.


## Death of husband #3

So yeah we are kind spoiling the ending, but Caterina got remarried to a Medici.


Now, did he die stabbed? No, second most common cause of death in. The Gout.
But at least he died the same way I want to go: inside a spa in Tuscany.

## The siege of Forli'

## Third act crisis

So, what did Cesare Borgia do to Caterina while she was in captivity? The answer is, unfortunately, yes.

## The legacy

For instance, in 1488 Caterina was defending the castle of Ravaldino, in Forli', which was sieged by her enemies, the Orsis. To try and break the stalemate, the Orsis brought Caterina's young children in front of the fortress and threatened to slit their throats had Caterina not opened the gates.
Well, legend says that Caterina went on the ramparts and yelled: "Go ahead and do it, you fools!" then she raised her skirt. "I have the means to make others!"
That's when she got the nickname The Tigress of Forli', which is also the title of a book on her life that I thoroughly enjoyed. Best read with a map of Italy on your lap as if it was Middle-earth. The dwarves are the Sardinians.

This is her portrayed by Botticelli as someone who, despite being uber pregnant, gets shit done, which is quintessential Caterina.

This is the castle of Ravaldino, where Caterina's kids were supposedly traumatized for life by her mother...

If reading is not in your toolset, you can still enjoy bits of Renaissance with a couple of TV shows. The first one is Medici: Masters of Florence, on Amazon Prime.
I haven't watched it, so I can't vouch for its quality, but it stars Dustin Hoffman and the dumbest of the Stark siblings. The story should include the Pazzi Conspiracy, a sort of red wedding that was orchestrated by Caterina's idiot husband.

In season 3, for the casting of Caterina, they just decided to clone Emilia Clarke...

Or you could watch The Borgias, with Jeremy Irons. It's on HBO, which means probably a lot of barely justifiable nudities.

I don't advise that you play Assassin's Creed II. It's not a very good game, I'm not sure how much of that actually happened, and Caterina there speaks like Super Mario. I tried switching to the Italian language, but was compelled to revert when Ezio's mother said "topa".

I would like to visit Forli', but compared to where I live and the main connecting train lines / roads, it's a bit "in culo".
