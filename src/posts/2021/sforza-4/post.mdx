## Giacomo's dark half

For a former stable boy, Giacomo proved to be a little unstable. He asad power grab, he slapped Ottaviano Riario, Caterina's first child, heir to Forli and one of the children menace at knife point by the Orsi.

That is to say that we like to blame aristocrats for their orgies, their cavalier use of taxes, their dumb tweets about Doge Coin, and we come up with solutions like tax the rich, something something, communism! But the thing is... people are dicks.

Now that we have deconstructed Giacomo to a piece of shit, what do we know about the conspirators. Well, they were incredibly close to Caterina. The closest one we will call Mister X and we will reveal his/her name later, for effect.

The others? Let's just say that the hand that went all stabby-stabby on Giacomo, was non other than XXX Checchi, which we met briefly in Part 3. He was the guard that arrested horny Tommaso Feo. Shock!

Caterina sent a raven to Tommaso, exiled in Imola: "Look, you might be angry at me maybe? But your lil bro is dead. Help me murder the people responsible."

## The angel of death

What follows, is the gruesome account of the acts that Caterina Sforza and Tommaso Feo committed to avenge poor cunty Giacomo. It's a bit much to take in, so please read the paragraph by listening to this song. It should help.

Do I think that Caterina was over the line with all these acts? Yes.

Would I personally want my wife to avenge my murder by killing 38 people? Also yes.


## The angel of death

So yeah we are kind spoiling the ending, but Caterina got remarried to a Medici.



## The Medici

Also named Giovanni. Let's put a pin here, because this is going to be a character so cool that we will have to expand for sure.

At least, he died the same way I want to go, inside a spa in Tuscany.

Now, did he die stabbed? No, second most common cause of death in. The Gout.
But at least he died the same way I want to go: inside a spa in Tuscany.

Top 5 causes of death in Renaissance Italy
1. People going all stabby-stabby on you
2. The gout
3. A series of illnesses that involve drinking poop
4. Sudden death in the cradle (like one of those windows blue screens)
5. Old age (around 49)


So, what did Cesare Borgia do to Caterina while she was in captivity? The answer is, unfortunately, yes.

## The legacy


In season 3, for the casting of Caterina, they just decided to clone Emilia Clarke...

Or you could watch The Borgias, with Jeremy Irons. It's on HBO, which means probably a lot of barely justifiable nudities.

I don't advise that you play Assassin's Creed II. It's not a very good game, I'm not sure how much of that actually happened, and Caterina there speaks like Super Mario. I tried switching to the Italian language, but was compelled to revert when Ezio's mother said "topa".

Don't we all want to be loved by someone that would murder 36 people in case we died?

Stay tuned for Part 5, where finally we introduced the Thanos of the story. Motherfucking Cesare Borgia.
