Do you ever have impostor syndrome? I do!

Oh, hi real quick I just wanted to remind you that you are a little shit. Complete an utter shit shaped worthless human. I know it, you know it, and soon everyone else will know it.

There is going to be a reckoning.

The previous company will call the new company and say no, we don't know this guy

The university will call and say that after a routine check it turned out you didn't really get a software engineering degree. Upon closer inspection, it seems like you were enrolled in gender studies, and you didn't even finish!

All the women you have dated whose league you were completely out of

So yeah that's how I feel.

But it doesn't have to be like this!

There is a way of overcoming impostor syndrome and it's under the spoiler tag.

I was not being serious. There is no way of overcoming imposotr syndrome. You are but a worthless piece of shit.
