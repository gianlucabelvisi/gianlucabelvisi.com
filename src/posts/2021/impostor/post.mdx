Do you ever have impostor syndrome? I do!

<Pony>
    Hey, I hope I didn't wake you up by continuously tapping on your shoulder while you were sleeping.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    Real quick, I wanted to give you the daily reminder that you are a little shit. Just a complete an utter crap shaped worthless human piece of garbage. And not even the fancy one. No, the stinky garbage that no hipster would ever scavenge and ironically collect.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    I know it, you know it, and soon everyone else will know it.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    There is going to be a reckoning.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    The company that just hired you will be like we might have pooped out of the bidet with this guy.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    So they will call your previous company and ask for confirmation, and they will say our bad, we were actually so eager to see him out that we might have retained important information on him being literal shit.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    All the other companies will recursively be called, and they will all confirm the amount of shittage until the University of Pisa will be notified.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    The University of Pisa will then carry out an investigation at the end of which you'll be contacted call and say that after a routine check it turned out you didn't really get a software engineering degree. Upon closer inspection, it seems like you were enrolled in gender studies, and you didn't even finish!
</Pony>

<Pony>
    So you owe a whole bunch of monthly salaries to everyone that employed you.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    Adding to that, all the women you have dated whose league you were completely out of -- and let's be honest here, it's all of them -- will get wind of your demise that use the chance to meet up and discuss all your failings. They will end up writing a book of the conversation, titled The Moron. And I won't even tell you the subtitle because I hate seeing a grownup man cry.
</Pony>

So yeah that's how I feel.

But it doesn't have to be like this!

There is a way of overcoming impostor syndrome and it's under the spoiler tag.

I was not being serious. There is no way of overcoming imposotr syndrome. You are but a worthless piece of shit.



Do you suffer from Impostor Syndrome or know somebody that does and this person is you?

I have recently changed job

My impostor syndrome takes the shape of a My Little Pony living on my shoulder, occasionally chewing my hair and whispering words of wisdom such as:

By the way, I just want to remind you that you are a piece of shit. I know it. You know it. And soon, everyone else will know it.

There will be a reckoning.

The new employer will see you for the fraud you are. They will ask about you to the old employer. The old employer

The university will ultimately be called, and this is where it turns out that you didn't graduate in Software Engineering as you thought you did. You had actually enrolled by mistake in Gender Studies, and by the way, you failed it.

So you have to pay back all the salary you received until now, reverse-commit all the code, and vomit all the free coffee.

Alerted by the news of your demise, all the women you have dated whose league you were completely out of - and let's be honest here, it's all of them - will meet and talk about your failings as a human person.

They will take the chance to write a book out of it. A cautionary tale called The Moron. And I don't even want to tell you the subtitle because I hate to see an adult cry.

How to overcome Impostor Syndrome.

There is no overcoming Impostor Syndrome. Didn't you understand the bit about you being a worthless piece of shit? Color me unsurprised!

Alright, I'm kidding, find the carefully crafted instructions here.

Fake it till you make it.

If you think that the above is good advice, congratulations, you are a moron!

What exactly are you thinking to fake it till you make it? Are you faking competence? Are you faking experience? Wisdom? Knowing the beer fridge combination?

There is only one way of calling the fake of the above: delusion.

The only thing you can fake is courage. But then again, isn't all courage fake?

"Life shrinks or extends in proportion to one's courage"
Anais Nin

Einstein carried his luggage.

We need to do things when we are not ready, otherwise, we will never be.

If we argue hard about our limitations, weâ€™ll get to keep them



Look at the people that are currently doing the thing you are so scared of doing. Are they by any chance a bunch of eight-packed hammer wielding divinities?

No. Exactly. They are not Jesus. They are just some random farting in bed, peeing in the shower people trying to make ends meet exactly like you.


People that show an unnatural amount of courage are like this because they received too many compliments as kids.

If instead you weren't complimented enough, if not straight up diminished, you are probably scared. But rejoice, because people that were complimented exactly the correct amount of time, might live a balanced life, but they are also boring.
