Do you ever have impostor syndrome? I do!

<Pony>
    Hey, I hope I didn't wake you up by continuously tapping on your shoulder while you were sleeping.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    Real quick, I wanted to give you the daily reminder that you are a little shit. Just a complete an utter crap shaped worthless human piece of garbage. And not even the fancy one. No, the stinky garbage that no hipster would ever scavenge and ironically collect.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    I know it, you know it, and soon everyone else will know it.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    There is going to be a reckoning.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    The company that just hired you will be like we might have pooped out of the bidet with this guy.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    So they will call your previous company and ask for confirmation, and they will say our bad, we were actually so eager to see him out that we might have retained important information on him being literal shit.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    All the other companies will recursively be called, and they will all confirm the amount of shittage until the University of Pisa will be notified.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    The University of Pisa will then carry out an investigation at the end of which you'll be contacted call and say that after a routine check it turned out you didn't really get a software engineering degree. Upon closer inspection, it seems like you were enrolled in gender studies, and you didn't even finish!
</Pony>

<Pony>
    So you owe a whole bunch of monthly salaries to everyone that employed you.
</Pony>

<Pony>
    Adding to that, all the women you have dated whose league you were completely out of -- and let's be honest here, it's all of them -- will get wind of your demise that use the chance to meet up and discuss all your failings. They will end up writing a book of the conversation, titled The Moron. And I won't even tell you the subtitle because I hate seeing a grownup man cry.
</Pony>

So yeah that's how I feel.

But it doesn't have to be like this!

There is a way of overcoming impostor syndrome and it's under the spoiler tag.
