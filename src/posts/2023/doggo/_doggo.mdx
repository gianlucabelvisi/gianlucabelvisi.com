In this blog post, we will attempt something that has **never** been done before. We are going to find the fun in *fundamental animal rights not to be mistreated*.

This is a **touchy** subject, which explains the **royal we** in the previous sentence. Getting some distance with the author, whose views I do not necessarily endorse.

In the [Philosophy](/philosophy) post, I made an **Anne Frank** joke and nobody seemed to mind because, of course, she was the subject of the joke, and not the target. The target was the inherent contradictions that arise when blindly following ethical prescriptions, as I'm sure you understood.

Similarly, the purpose of this post is not cracking jokes at the expense of pets. To understand the true target <small>(spoiler: it's humans)</small>, you will have to reach its conclusion, which many of you won't do because, even with these caveats and explanations, at the only hint of a fictional animal being mistreated, you will literally lose your minds.

![Won't somebody think of the pets!](somebody.jpg)

In an attempt to help you reaching the end of this post, I have carefully placed a few piece of shit emoji next to the most egregious jokes.

<UnicornButton page={"doggo"} id={"1"} tooltip={"What a piece of fecal matter!"}/>

<p>‚òùüèΩ <small>Feel free to try it</small></p>

Whenever you dislike a punchline, spam-click said emoji. This will:
1. Make you feel better.
2. Deliver valuable feedback directly in my inbox üóë.
3. Cost me database money, so please be mindful. üëâüèΩüëàüèΩü•∫

Cool? Cool

## I hope this isn't a mistake

Speaking of, have you ever made a mistake?

I can't be the only sucker. I'm sure you have gone through a rough patches in your life ‚Äî and please do not say *reading this blog post*, because that would be funny at my expense, meaning I will have to cut the tires of your car. And if you don‚Äôt own a car, then I'm gonna have to murder you. I mean you left me no choice.



Here's the thing with mistakes, they are sticky. They really are. When people look at you, they will always see your biggest mistake.

Oh, here‚Äôs the guy that pooped into the swimming pool on your birthday!

I think I speak for everybody when I say that mistakes should only be accounted in the moment that they happen, as a singularity. And sure, if one focuses on that spike, of course it reflects badly on you, like when you run over someone with the car and the person chooses that as an opportunity to die.

But looking at your life as a whole, then the error should average out.

"Yes, he did run over someone, which wasn‚Äôt nice. But have you tried his cooking? Significantly fewer people died from his cooking!"

But this is not what happens, and as a result we live in constant fear of making an error, and be canceled for it. For instance, I'm super scared of having sex with my girlfriend‚Äôs sister by mistake.

And if that happened, then no matter what I say in my defense: we were drunk, she started it, she looks exactly like you in a much younger body‚Äî it‚Äôs not gonna matter!

Now, I want to clarify that I‚Äôve never had sex with my girlfriend‚Äôs sister. In fact, any sisters at all. Not even nuns if you can believe it.

No, the mistake I‚Äôve made is much, much worse. I will share it with you if you promise me that it doesn‚Äôt leave the room. Ready? Ok, I once watched a YouTube video where a guy risked his life to save a dog that had fallen into the river.

Well, now YouTube thinks that I like the genre and keeps suggesting videos of cute animals in danger, and I‚Äôm no longer being fed with new covers of the song ‚ÄúToss a coin to your Witcher‚Äù, and this is easily the worst thing that has ever happened to me! (This must be the whitest thing someone has ever said.)

It‚Äôs crazy. It seems like people can't get enough of these videos of good citizens saving animals, and I guess I understand, what with all that‚Äôs going on these days, one can really use the occasional uplifting story. Which is why these videos collect millions of views. On ad revenue only, you can easily make north of fifty thousand dollars per upload.

And that makes me wonder, what if the people that save the animals, are the same people that put those animals in danger, so that they can then shoot the rescue and cash in?

I want to be clear. I‚Äôm not saying that this is what happens, I'm saying that this is what I would do!

And I think I would be good at it, you know? I would do it the smart way, not the right way.

Picture for instance these videos of dogs greeting their owners returning from the war. You see a guy coming back home, with his backpack and uniform, and as soon as the door opens, the Labrador goes nuts! He thought that his daddy was gone forever and now there he is. He starts whining and barking and licking and jumping and everybody is in tears!

Now, there are two ways of making this kind of content.

The first one is to get a puppy, treat him with love for years, then join the army, be shipped to Afghanistan, kill some nazis, survive, return, and shoot the encounter. This solution gets the job done, but doesn‚Äôt optimize for time, and as a side effect you end up murdering a bunch of people that probably didn‚Äôt deserve it.

Or!

You could simply turn your dog into a heroin addict, and be sure to always give him the drug while wearing a uniform. Then you leave him without heroin for a couple of weeks, and finally show up in camouflage!

Let me give you another example to prove you that I‚Äôm not a one trick pony.

Take those videos of extremely obese dogs and their road to weight loss. You see them initially trying to stand up and fall on their asses. The next scene is them attempting a walk with a stroller, then cut to them jogging in a shallow pool, and finally you see them slim and happy, chasing a ball like a dumb football player.

Really inspiring stuff! If the doggo can do it, what‚Äôs keeping me on this sofa? eat a burger

Now, can you imagine how difficult these videos are to make? You need to become both a personal trainer and a nutritionist! Or do you? Because you could start with a slim dog, feed him ten thousand calories per day, shoot the whole process up until the dog is a giant ball, then edit the footage in reverse order like in that movie Memento!

With these ideas, I think I could create a whole organization, open offices around the world, hire people, design a logo that is  like a paw but if you look closely you realize that it‚Äôs shaped as a heart?

I think I would pay full healthcare, pension, and extra vacation days to my employees, because I'm not a fucking monster.

Then I would spend my days on zoom, coordinating shit:
"Guys, we can't throw the baby elephant in the river today because there's been a delay with the catapult. In theory, we could do the video with the head of the giraffe stuck in the rusty mailbox, but Michael has been starving this Greyhound for two weeks now and if we don't shoot his rescue we might lose the window of opportunity.‚Äù

Then, after uploading each video, I would add a link in the description to raise money for a non-existing animal charity, and I would put a heart under every comment that says: "Fate in humanity: restored!‚Äù

I can see that some of you are horrified. Well, wake the fuck up! If animals knew how to operate a camera and had basic knowledge of Final Cut Pro, they would do the same to us!

Anyway, I‚Äôm thinking of getting a dog.

I mean a dog for personal use, not work related. Jesus Christ, no!

I don‚Äôt know, maybe the pandemic did a number on me. I‚Äôve been at home sitting on my ass for so long that I‚Äôm starting to feel the need of a friend ‚Äî a bro! ‚Äî someone that is always by my side and that does everything I tell him do to otherwise no food.

Now, getting a dog is kind of a big decision. You don‚Äôt want to make a mistake in that regard, because mistreating your dog is really frowned upon, and I say rightly so. If you think about it, the one with your dog is going to the most important relationship of your life because the two of you will be together for the rest of the dog‚Äôs life. Or yours.

To bring the point home, you might think that you love your boyfriend or girlfriend, husband or wife, yoga instructor or world of warcraft character, but can you say that you have touched their shit every day while still lukewarm?

Some of you might actually have.

And sure, you can cut fifty percent of the dog‚Äôs poop if you only feed him every other day, but that‚Äôs still a lot of poop if you compare it with the amount of poop I‚Äôd like to deal with, which is zero poop.

(I‚Äôm not saying do it. I‚Äôm saying look into it.)

Now, if you are horrified by the idea of me starving a dog to decrease the pooping, or turning him into a heroin addict for the purpose of making money, tell me, how do you justify the fact that you cut off your dog‚Äôs testicles? You bunch of hypocrites!

I‚Äôm gonna say it: cutting your dog‚Äôs balls is a huge mistake and you should be canceled for it. Personally, I would never do it, unless there is a strong video idea behind.

And I would never do it not only because I think it‚Äôs wrong, but also because I‚Äôm planning to train my dog, and reward is a key element of training, and every once in a while I‚Äôd like to reward my dog with something more than a treat or a toy. I would like to reward him with pussy.

Yes, I would like to occasionally bring my dog to canine escorts. And please appreciate how I used the sophisticated term ‚Äúcanine escorts‚Äù even if in this case, semantically, I could have said bitches.

‚ÄúHey Rufus, come! Good boy. We are going out! No, no, don‚Äôt bring a toy with you. Leave it. Trust me, this time you won‚Äôt need it! Oh, but you know what you are gonna need? 600 euros.‚Äù

Anyway, congratulations, you have decided to get a dog and now you have an important question in front of you:
‚ÄúShould I save a dog?‚Äù

Now, in rhetoric, this is called ‚Äúbegging the question‚Äù and is considered a dishonest debate technique, because the way you phrase the question already implies what the correct answer is.

‚ÄúShould you save a dog?‚Äù Well, duh!

‚ÄúShould you murder your grandma because she‚Äôs old and annoying?‚Äù Come on, of course I shouldn‚Äôt‚Äî if you put it that way.

‚ÄúHoney, will you pick me up at the airport of do you prefer that I take the bus?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Of course I will quit this open heart surgery and come to the airport! As if taking the bus was really an option for you, bitch!‚Äù

A more honest version of ‚Äòshould I save a dog?‚Äô is the following:
‚Äúshould I get a shit dog?‚Äù

Because that‚Äôs what we are talking about. And this is not a judgement on dogs themselves, but on us. I believe that we as a Society have become too spoiled, what with our smartphones, our streaming services, and the possibility of pulling water to make the poop go away, and as a result we are not equipped with the skills to own a shit dog.

These dogs have experienced more trauma that you could ever handle. They have lived life on the streets. They had to search for leftovers in the trash. They had to do blow jobs to survive.

Luckily, in the country I live in ‚Äî Sweden ‚Äî there are no stray dogs, so saving a dog is a decision we don‚Äôt have to take, which is great! Now, how did Sweden manage to do it? Trust me, we don‚Äôt wanna know!

Ok, fine, here‚Äôs my theory. Ikea furniture is not made of compressed sawdust. It‚Äôs made of dog. Basically there‚Äôs this mold and a guy with a shovel filling it with dogs. Stray dogs. Then the mold closes and there you have your Kallax bookshelf. This is why, when you spill water on Ikea furniture, you smell wet dog.

So, while there are no stray dogs in Sweden, you can still get them from other countries. Most of those dogs these days come from Romania; great exported of shit dogs.

What happens is that there are organizations that pick up stray dogs from the streets of Bucharest and park them into dirty kennels. Then you connect to a website that doesn‚Äôt have the secure connection lock, that uses five different kinds of fonts, and is only compatible with Internet Explorer 4.

So you give you credit card details to what seems to be an absolutely legit enterprise. You choose your dog based on a picture that says this dog will be executed in 5 days if nobody saves him. And when enough orders are filled, all the dogs are crammed into a van and carried for days around Europe to their respective owners.

Now can you imagine how these poor dogs are feeling in this tight and dark space? They left a terrible place, a ghetto. Now they are traveling to an undisclosed location and have no clue on what‚Äôs coming next.

‚ÄúHey, what do you think is gonna happen to us?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I hope we go to a nice place with food and balls. I like me some balls!‚Äù

Then the dog in the corner that has remained silent for the whole time says: ‚ÄúGuys, I don‚Äôt think you understand the gravity of the situation. You see, before I became a stray dog, I watched a movie with my human. The movie was called Schindler‚Äôs List, and let me tell you, I‚Äôm seeing parallels!‚Äù

And after such a difficult life and an ordeal of a journey, try convincing the dog that everything is going to be alright.

‚ÄúHey bro, please stop shaking. You are safe now. No, don‚Äôt go back under the bed! You are acting like this is a concentration camp, but I can assure you it‚Äôs not! Now, come on, let‚Äôs go take a shower!‚Äù

So, yeah, consider not saving a dog.

Instead, you need to get a dog from a breeder. Now, getting a dog from a breeder is not easy. It seems like the pandemic did a number on a lot of people, who have been at home sitting on their asses for so long that now they all want a dog. Dickheads.

And apparently breeders cannot increase puppy production by force impregnating their dogs because that‚Äôs considered immoral. So you need to figure out a plan to beat the competition.

What you want to do is establish a relationship with all the breeders in the area that have the kind of dog that you want, so that when the time comes you can be selected for of their puppies. To achieve this, you need to go the extra mile. You are gonna need to lie.

In my case, I‚Äôve always wanted a Golden Retriever, because they are funny and playful and they love you unconditionally, which is how I like my love to be. Unconditional.

So what I did is I wrote a letter and sent it to all the breeders that have Golden Retrievers. And this letter was filled with so many lies it was ridiculous!

I told them that I‚Äôve always dreamed to own a Golden Retriever because when I was very little I got lost in a forest and was found by a couple and their Golden Retriever named Kevin!

I told them that I live in a house in the countryside with a large backyard, which I would never do because I‚Äôm scared of crickets!

I also told them that my fianc√© is a dog trainer, which is ludicrous as I don‚Äôt have a fianc√© and I would never date a dog trainer because I‚Äôm afraid that she would employ the same training techniques with me, and I know they would be effective because I love dog food way too much!

Now when it comes to lying, it‚Äôs very important that you never contradict yourself. There are exactly zero mistakes that you can do. You have to go full method and become Daniel Day Fucking Lewis.

For instance, I know every detail of the forest I was ‚Äúsaved‚Äù in when I was a kid. So if you write that you fell into a well and were saved by a dog using a rope ‚Äî kinda like the opposite of those YouTube videos ‚Äî then when you go visit the breeder you need to let them know that you can‚Äôt be in closed spaces because of your claustrophobia.

So, after sending this batch of emails, I just sat waiting for a reply. After a few weeks of no answers, I thought you know what? Border Collies are also nice. They look exactly like Golden Retrievers, but in black and white rather than gold. They are like the previous technology of a Golden Retriever. They are the iPhone 4s of the Golden Retriever.

So I found a bunch of Border Collie breeders and sent them the very same email. And after a few more weeks, I got a response! This breeder couple wrote me that they read my email and were in tears! They told me that while they don‚Äôt have any puppies at the moment, I would be the first in line when the time comes.
But they added: we only have one question‚Äî why do you want a Border Collie, if when you were a kid you were saved by a Golden Retriever?
