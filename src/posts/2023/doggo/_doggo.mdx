Today, we are setting out to achieve the **unprecedented**. We will find the fun in *fundamental animal rights not to be mistreated*. There it is.

This is a **touchy** subject, hence the **royal we**. Creating some distance with the author, whose views I don't necessarily endorse.

In the [Philosophy](/philosophy) writeup, I made an **Anne Frank** joke and nobody seemed to mind because, of course, she was only the **subject** of the joke, and not the target. The target was the inherent contradictions that arise when following moral prescriptions blindly, as you surely understood.

In the same vein, this post is not making light of animals' plights. To discern its true target (spoiler it's people), you will have to reach the **conclusion**, which many of you won't do because, even with these caveats, at the only **hint** of a fictional pet being mistreated, you will literally lose your minds.

![Won't somebody think of the pets!](somebody.jpg)

<FigureLabel>And the epistemic reason for such a reaction is: they look cute</FigureLabel>

To aid your journey through the emotional roller coaster that is this post, should you choose to embark it, I have strategically placed a few **piece-of-shit** emojis next to the most contentious jokes.

Okay? Okay.

## I hope this isn't a mistake

Speaking of, have you ever made a mistake? I can't be the only one. I'm sure you have had your share of **rough edits**.

Here's the thing with mistakes, they are **sticky**. When people look at you, they will inevitably see your biggest blunder:

<Dialogue>Look, there's the guy that <strong>pooped</strong> in your trombone thinking it was a toilet.</Dialogue>

I'm sure we can all agree that mistakes should hold weight within the **immediate** timeframe of their occurrence.

![Science](graph.png)

Mistakes are **singularities** and need to be treated as such. If one zooms in on a jagged peak, for instance focusing on the mushroom infused party where they took place or even up until the following morning's **jazz audition**, naturally they cast an unfavorable light on you.

Yet, when viewing your life in **landscape mode**, these aberrations tend to average away.

But this balance is rarely achieved, and so we live in constant dread of stumbling because of one *faux-pas*, like *accidentally* sleeping with your girlfriend's sister. If that were to occur, no matter your defense, be it 'we were drunk', 'she initiated it', 'she looks like you but works out regularly' ‚Äî none of it would make any difference.

Now, I want to stress that I've never slept with no girlfriend's sister. In fact, I've steered clear of any sisters entirely, nuns included if you can believe it. <small>(More on this in a future post.)</small>

## My mistake

No, the mistake I've made is far worse. I will share it on the promise that it doesn't leave the blog.

<Pony>
    I once watched a YouTube video where a bunch of men risked their life to save a dog that had fallen into the river.
</Pony>

<YouTube source={"smGQUH5ldTA"}/>

Well, now **YouTube** thinks that I'm into the genre and keeps suggesting videos of animals in peril, meaning that I am no longer being fed with tutorials on how to make 48-hours fermented pizza, which is why I keep delivering these ungrateful turds...

![The circular shape is very difficult if you don't know past the first decimal of pi](pizza.jpg)

<FigureLabel>The ultimate reason I was kicked out of Italy</FigureLabel>

It seems like people can't get enough of this kind of content, and I guess I understand, what with all that is in the news these days, one can use the occasional **uplifting** story.

Incidentally, it's why these videos collect millions of views. On **ad revenue**, you can make north of fifty thousand dollars per upload.

Which makes me wonder. ü§î

<Dialogue>
    What if the people that save the animals are the same people that put them in danger, so that they can then shoot the rescue and cash in? üí∞ü§ë
</Dialogue>

<UnicornButton page={"doggo"} id={"2"} tooltip={"Shut the eff up they would never!"}/>

![They would never!](donotwant.jpg)

I want to be clear. I‚Äôm **not** saying that this is what happens, I'm only saying that this is what I would do.

And I think I would be good at it. I would do it the **smart way**, not the right way.

## The feels

For instance, picture these videos of dogs greeting their owners returning from the war.

<YouTube source={"d6kjZXwdyJs?start=32"}/>

<FigureLabel>I'm in tears üò≠</FigureLabel>

Now, there are **two ways** of producing a video like this.

The first is to get a **puppy**, treat her with love for years, then join the army, be shipped to Afghanistan, kill some nazis, survive, return, and finally shoot the encounter.

This solution gets the job done, but does not optimize for time, creates a sweeping opportunity cost, and as a side-effect you end up **murdering** a bunch of people that probably didn't deserve it.

<Pony>OR!</Pony>

You could turn your dog into a **heroin addict** and be sure to always administer the dope while wearing a uniform. Then you leave her without heroin for a couple of weeks, and finally show up in **camouflage**.

<UnicornButton page={"doggo"} id={"3"} tooltip={"You are literally Saddam Hitler"}/>

## Motivational

Let me give you another example to prove you that I‚Äôm not a **one-trick pony**. <small><i>Opens the Notes app and writes down "one-trick pony video idea".</i></small>

Take those videos of morbidly obese dogs and their road to weight loss.

<YouTube source={"qxLHl6upZMk"}/>

To reach this level of BMI, they probably come from a **dysfunctional** family, which is a tragedy in and of itself.

You see them clumsily walk and fall on their bellies. Cue the sad music. However, they do not give up. They rise again. Cut to them jogging in a shallow pool. The music changes pace as the **training montage** kicks in. They venture to climb stairs and manage not to roll downhill. Finally, as the crescendo hits the apogee, you see them slim and playful, chasing a ball like a dumb soccer player.

Really inspiring stuff! If the doggo can do it, what‚Äôs keeping me on the **sofa**?

Now, can you imagine how difficult these videos are to make? You need to become both a personal trainer and a nutritionist. Or do you? Because you could start with a slim dog, feed him ten thousand calories per day, shoot the whole process up until the dog looks like a giant hairy testicle, then edit the footage in reverse order like in that movie **Memento**.

<UnicornButton page={"doggo"} id={"4"} tooltip={"This is disgusting but what an amazing film"}/>

![I'm not sure I get it](memento.png)

<FigureLabel>This took me one hour to make so please do not scroll away so quickly! üò≠</FigureLabel>

## The plan

With ideas like these, I believe I could create a profitable startup and open offices around the world but mostly in **India**.

I would design a logo that is shaped like a paw, but if you look close, you realize that it‚Äôs a heart.

![Midjourney](logo3.jpg)

<FigureLabel>(C) 2023. All rights reserved.</FigureLabel>

I know that I would pay full **healthcare**, pension, and extra vacation days to my employees, because I'm not a monster.

I would spend my days on **Zoom**, walking inside my comically unfurnished loft, wearing airpods, holding a plush ball, and coordinating production:

<Dialogue>
    Guys, we can't throw the <strong>baby elephant</strong> into the sinkhole today because there's been a delay with the catapult. In theory, we could shoot the video with the head of the giraffe stuck inside a <strong>rusty mailbox</strong>, but Deepak has been starving a Greyhound for weeks now and if we don't shoot his rescue soon we might lose the window of opportunity.
</Dialogue>

<UnicornButton page={"doggo"} id={"5"} tooltip={"Would actually watch them videos, but no like, no sir"}/>

After uploading each video, I would add a link in the description to raise money for a non-existing **animal charity**. Then, I would put a heart under every comment that says:

<Pony>
    Fate in humanity: restored! ü´∂üèΩ
</Pony>

Since by reading these lines you gave me consent to access your camera, I can see how **horrified** you are right now. Well, wake the **eff** up! If animals knew how to operate a camera and had semi-professional knowledge of **Final Cut Pro**, they would do the same to us!

![mooo](cow.png)

<FigureLabel>You can tell that this is AI generated by the number of ports on that laptop</FigureLabel>

Anyway, I have been thinking of getting a dog.

## Wait, what?

I mean a dog for personal use. Not work related. God, no!

![Doggo is doomscrolling](doggo.png)

<FigureLabel>But dog was looking for a job üò•</FigureLabel>

I guess I'm opening my heart here.

I think that the **pandemic** has done a number on me. I have spent two years in almost complete isolation, sitting on my ass, working from home, staring at the wall, trying to keep my mind busy with mundane activities, and it was awesome!

I had so many cool projects to focus on and nobody around who was super **opinionated** on what to do, like going to the mall to purchase textile materials to cover your body with.

Inebriated by the endless possibilities, I recall thinking:

<Pony>Am I wasting this pandemic by not doing enough?</Pony>

At some point, after a session of several hours online looking for piano lessons, cocktail recipes, podcasts in Spanish, blender courses, Blender courses, old arcades emulation, quantum mechanics, mountaineering documentaries, a year by year chronicle of the Roman Empire, clown porn, value investing, animals in danger, Renaissance history, I realized that I was deep into a toxic spiral of **rumination**, and that all these activities were just a clumsy way of escaping the fundamental issue.

In response to that, I felt the need for a true **friendship**. A bro! Someone that is always by my side, that loves me for who I am and not who they feel I should be. That knows me better than I know myself. That does everything I say otherwise no food.

In short, I felt like what I sorely needed was a Golden Retriever named **Renato**.

## Wait, and I cannot stress this enough, what?

This might come across as oddly specific. Let me break it down for you.

First, I choose my dogs the same way I choose my dates and **Baldur's Gate** companions. I value intelligence and goofiness. Now, if gifs have taught me anything, is that Golden Retrievers are hella goofy.

<ResponsiveEmbed src={"https://giphy.com/embed/xNPB9OnYtIGzK"} ratio={"4:3"}/>

When it comes to wits, here's a list of breeds from smartest to dumbest...

* Border Collie üß†üèÜ
* Poodle
* German Shepherd
* Golden Retriever
* Doberman Pinscher
* ...
* Pekingese
* Beagle
* Neapolitans
* Mastiff
* French Bulldog üß†ü•¥

Which makes me want to go for a **Golden Retriever** because, while I do want a smart dog, I don't necessarily need one that is smarter than I am. Retaining my alpha-ness is important to me.

And finally, why the name **Renato**? No particular reason except the fact that naming a dog Renato is hilarious to me! By simply thinking about it, I'm giggling like a French Bulldog!

<TextBox title="Let me be clear" closeable={true}>
    <p>If your name is Renato, please know that I mean no disrespect. In fact, I'm pretty sure that you are a good boy.</p>
</TextBox>

Then, I think I would just walk the earth with my new friend, obviously with **no leash** as the peers we are, despite me being the clear alpha.

We would be hopping from village to village in feudal **Japan** doing sub-quests, bedding ladies, righting wrongs, wronging rights, keeping it fair and balanced.

## Getting a dog

This probably comes at no surprise, but getting a dog is kind of a **big decision**. You don‚Äôt want to make a mistake in that regard, because mistreating your dog is really frowned upon, and I say rightly so.

If you think about it, the one with your dog is going to the most important relationship of your life. The two of you will be together for the rest of the dog‚Äôs life. Or yours if you rank among the non-vaccinated.

To bring the point home, you might think that you love your boyfriend or girlfriend, husband or wife, yoga instructor or world of warcraft character, but can you say that you have touched their poop every day while still **lukewarm**?

I actually know people that have.

<ResponsiveEmbed ratio={"16:9"} src={"https://giphy.com/embed/SpPVAQT0mQXzq"}/>

And sure, you can reduce the dog's poop output by a whopping **fifty percent** if you opt to feed him every other day. However, while an improvement, this would still be a far cry from the ideal amount, which is zero poop.

<UnicornButton page={"doggo"} id={"6"} tooltip={"This is making me big mad"}/>

Wow, someone's **big mad** right now. Again, I'm not saying do it. I'm only saying look into it. Now let's talk about your hypocrisy.

## Your hypocrisy

If you are aghast at the thought of me withholding food from a dog to reduce waste, or turning him into a heroin addict for entertainment purposes, how can you justify **neutering** them?

Let me make it clear: I believe that removing a dog's testicles is ethically bankrupt, so I would **never** consider such a procedure, unless there was a strong YouTube video idea behind.

<UnicornButton page={"doggo"} id={"7"} tooltip={"Would totally watch, but no like"}/>

My stance isn't solely based on a moral prescriptions. It also aligns with my approach to training. Reward is pivotal in teaching a pet new skills, and sometimes a toy or a treat won't cut it, and I'd prefer to offer my dog experiences that cater to his **natural instincts**.

In short, I'd like to reward my friend with the opportunity of interacting with dogs of the female kind. Let's call it **canine companionship** so to speak. And please appreciate how I'm refraining from using the zoologically correct terminology.

<Dialogue>Renato, come! Good boy. We are going out! No, leave it! Don‚Äôt bring a toy with you. Trust me, this time you won‚Äôt need it!</Dialogue>

![Rose](rose.png)

<FigureLabel>But, my dear, you will need 600 euros plus extras</FigureLabel>

Be it as it may, congratulations! You have made the commendable decision to welcome a **doggo** into your life, and now you're faced with a pivotal question:

## Should I rescue a dog?

In the realm of rhetoric, this is known as **begging the question**, a method deemed intellectually dishonest in debate. This is because the framing of the question already presupposes the **correct** answer, thereby influencing the discourse in a biased manner.

<Dialogue>Should I rescue a dog?</Dialogue>

Well, duh!

<Dialogue>Should I murder my grandma because she‚Äôs old and annoying?</Dialogue>

Come on, of course I shouldn't. Not if you put it that way.

<Dialogue>Honey, I know that you are performing open-heart surgery today. Do you prefer if I Uber from the airport?</Dialogue>

Lmao, as if you would ever forgive me! I'll drop this loser dead and come pick you up.

The following is a more honest version of ‚Äòshould I save a dog?‚Äô:

<ShakyTitle emoji={"üí©"} title={"Should I get a shit dog?"}/>


<UnicornButton page={"doggo"} id={"7"} tooltip={"I don't like where this is going"}/>

Because that‚Äôs what we are talking about. And this isn't a critique of the dogs per se, but rather a reflection on us as a **society**.

I believe that we have become too spoiled, what with our smartphones, our streaming services, and the possibility of pulling water to make the waste go away to a place nobody knows about.

Consequently, we are not equipped with the skills and temperament to responsibly take care of a problematic pet.

These dogs have experienced more **trauma** that you could ever handle. They have navigated the harsh realities of street life, scavenged for discarded scraps. They had to turn tricks to survive.

Fortunately, in the land of Sweden of which I am a genetic citizen, the issue of stray dogs is non-existent, so saving a dog is a decision that I do not have to make, which is a relief.

Now, as for the methods employed by Sweden to reach **stray-dog zero**, let's just say the details might be a mystery best left unsolved!

<TextBox title={"Ok, fine"}>
    <p>
        Here is my theory on the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have long been told that Ikea furniture is crafted from compressed sawdust, rancid eggs, and baby vomit. My hypothesis? The primary ingredient might actually be dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Picture this: a specialized molding machine is in place, and a worker armed with a shovel is filling it up with strays. The mold then closes and voila ‚Äî out comes a Kallax.
    </p>
    <p>
        This explains why, whenever you accidentally spill water on Ikea furniture, the room is filled with the unmistakable aroma of wet dog.
    </p>
</TextBox>



So, while there are no stray dogs in Sweden, you can still get them from other countries. Most of those dogs these days come from Spain, Greece, or Romania. All great exporters of shit dogs.

## The harsh truth

What happens is that there are organizations that pick up stray dogs from the streets of Bucharest and park them into dirty kennels. Then you connect to a website that doesn‚Äôt have the secure connection lock, that uses five different kinds of fonts, and is only compatible with Internet Explorer 4.

So you give you credit card details to what seems to be an absolutely legit enterprise. You choose your dog based on a picture that says this dog will be executed in 5 days if nobody saves him. And when enough orders are filled, all the dogs are crammed into a van and carried for days around Europe to their respective owners.

Now can you imagine how these poor dogs are feeling in this tight and dark space? They left a terrible place, a ghetto. Now they are traveling to an undisclosed location and have no clue on what‚Äôs coming next.

![Van](van.png)

‚ÄúHey, what do you think is gonna happen to us?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I hope we go to a place with food and balls. I like me some balls!‚Äù

Then the dog in the corner that has remained silent for the whole time says:

‚ÄúGuys, I don‚Äôt think you understand the gravity of the situation. You see, before I became a stray dog, I watched a movie with my human. The movie was called Schindler‚Äôs List, and let me tell you, I‚Äôm seeing parallels!‚Äù

And after such a difficult life and an ordeal of a journey, try convincing the dog that everything is going to be alright.

‚ÄúHey bro, please stop shaking. You are safe now. No, don‚Äôt go back under the bed! You are acting like this is a concentration camp, but I can assure you it‚Äôs not! Now, come on, let‚Äôs go take a shower!‚Äù

So, yeah, consider not saving a dog.

## Breeders

Instead, you need to get a dog from a breeder. Now, getting a dog from a breeder is not easy. It seems like the pandemic did a number on a lot of people, who have been at home sitting on their asses for so long that now they all want a dog. Dickheads.

And apparently breeders cannot increase puppy production by force impregnating their dogs because that‚Äôs considered immoral. So you need to figure out a plan to beat the competition.

What you want to do is establish a relationship with all the breeders in the area that have the kind of dog that you want, so that when the time comes you can be selected for of their puppies. To achieve this, you need to go the extra mile. You are gonna need to lie.

In my case, I‚Äôve always wanted a Golden Retriever, because they are funny and playful and they love you unconditionally, which is how I like my love to be. Unconditional.

So what I did is I wrote a letter and sent it to all the breeders that have Golden Retrievers. And this letter was filled with so many lies it was ridiculous!

I told them that I‚Äôve always dreamed to own a Golden Retriever because when I was very little I got lost in a forest and was found by a couple and their Golden Retriever named Kevin!

I told them that I live in a house in the countryside with a large backyard, which I would never do because I‚Äôm scared of crickets!

I also told them that my fianc√© is a dog trainer, which is ludicrous as I don‚Äôt have a fianc√© and I would never date a dog trainer because I‚Äôm afraid that she would employ the same training techniques with me, and I know they would be effective because I love dog food way too much!

Now when it comes to lying, it‚Äôs very important that you never contradict yourself. There are exactly zero mistakes that you can do. You have to go full method and become Daniel Day Fucking Lewis.

For instance, I know every detail of the forest I was ‚Äúsaved‚Äù in when I was a kid. So if you write that you fell into a well and were saved by a dog using a rope ‚Äî kinda like the opposite of those YouTube videos ‚Äî then when you go visit the breeder you need to let them know that you can‚Äôt be in closed spaces because of your claustrophobia.

So, after sending this batch of emails, I just sat waiting for a reply. After a few weeks of no answers, I thought you know what? Border Collies are also nice. They look exactly like Golden Retrievers, but in black and white rather than gold. They are like the previous technology of a Golden Retriever. They are the iPhone 4s of the Golden Retriever.

So I found a bunch of Border Collie breeders and sent them the very same email. And after a few more weeks, I got a response! This breeder couple wrote me that they read my email and were in tears! They told me that while they don‚Äôt have any puppies at the moment, I would be the first in line when the time comes.
But they added: we only have one question‚Äî why do you want a Border Collie, if when you were a kid you were saved by a Golden Retriever?
