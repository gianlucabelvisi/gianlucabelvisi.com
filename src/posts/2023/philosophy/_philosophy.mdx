I‚Äôve been studying philosophy recently.

The reason for me to tackle such a discipline at the age of ~~47~~ ~~35~~ ~~29~~ 16 is that I have started writing a blog post about philosophy - this one if you can believe it! - and found myself not knowing a single thing about it. So this is a chicken and egg kind of situation.

And this is Philosophy in a nutshell.

See you in a month, we are going to talk about dogs. Down with Logos, gimme doggos!

**Update:** ok, who's the smartass that spam clicked the *piece of shit* emoji? I will find you. I have your IP. Someone can't really take a joke.

I find that it's essential to know a little about philosophy, and more importantly about **ethics**, because it really helps me feel a better person than you.



Which matters to me. Incidentally, it‚Äôs why I am on this slightly elevated stage talking with you ‚Äî talking **at** you! ‚Äî commenting about life, discussing things that inspire me, judging your dates...

And let me tell you, some of you can do so much **better**. You know who you are. And more importantly you know what you have to do!

Now, I want to be super clear on this because it's easy to misunderstand written and clear sentences. What I‚Äôm suggesting is that you **break up** with your date because they are uglier than you.

![Yes but what about the personality](orc.jpg)

## Breaking up

People say that there is no easy way to break up with someone, and to that I reply **bullshit**. Of course there is an easy way of breaking up with someone, and that is blaming the other person for **everything**.

But - you'll ask - what if they did not do anything to warrant a break-up? Well, then you must invent something. Do some work!

For instance, suppose that I'm at a restaurant with a girlfriend I want to break up with. Suppose that I'm chewing my food loudly, and she says:

‚ÄúDidn't your mom teach you good manners?‚Äù

That is an opening for my strike!

I will be like: ‚ÄúNo, my mother didn't teach me good manners. She didn't have the time. Too busy being a **prostitute** in Hungary to keep her 16 children alive, wasn't she?

I guess she could have done more. I‚Äôd be happy to ask her, but I can't, because she died of **Covid**, and today, among all days, is the first anniversary of her death. You know what maybe we shouldn‚Äôt see each other anymore!‚Äù

Then I break in **tears** and leave the restaurant without paying the bill.

Now, this strategy of blaming the other person for everything is also very useful because, at any moment, I can change my mind. I can call her back and say

"Hey real quick would you like to meet again? I‚Äôm... I‚Äôm trying hard to **forgive you**."

Because, fun fact about people, they all want to be forgiven. So this is something that you can take advantage of, as **Jesus** did.

![Perfect teeth](jesus2.jpeg)

<FigureLabel>Lmao, busted!</FigureLabel>

So we date a few times more, but now at any moment I have an easy way out because I can say:

"Look, I‚Äôve tried my best. You know I have. But every time I see your face, I think about that **toxic** comment you made about my poor mom!"

Then I break in tears and leave the restaurant without paying the bill.

But I digress. What was I talking about? Ah, ethics!

## Ethics

Ethics addresses a question that is as old as people. How **ought** one live?

According to which moral values should we base our existence upon? This is generally not defined via a bunch of rules such as don‚Äôt steal, don‚Äôt kill, don‚Äôt eat sugar after 3pm.

No, what happens instead is that you find your morality by pondering on how you would behave in a series of thought experiments, and among these, the most famous one is the **trolley problem**, which is not about whether you can carry said trolley with you on the flight, because we all know the answer is no, Vanessa. That shit‚Äôs huge! Also, not the best way of carrying your **labrador**.


<FigureLabel>Why u do this to dog?</FigureLabel>

Let me explain the trolley problem.

You are crossing a bridge over train tracks when you notice **five people** tied to the tracks. On the opposite side, a train is approaching fast, so you don‚Äôt have time to free them. Next to you, an **obese** person is there chilling. Eating a sandwich.

![](trolley.png)

So, what do you do? You can either do nothing, and let five people die. Or you could gently but firmly push the obese person over the bridge and against the train, making it stop and saving five lives, but at the cost of killing the one guy, who at least died doing what he loved. Eating a sandwich.

Side note. The person is not obese out of spite. The thought experiment requires this so that you don‚Äôt choose the so-called **Jesus** option:

<Pony>
    Oh, I would rather throw myself against the train, and save those five souls!
</Pony>

No, shut up Vanessa. You are not large enough to stop the train. And also, no you wouldn't! You would never sacrifice yourself to save others. Actually, you would shoot a **Tik-Tok** of the train mowing down those people, and then you would count the views while drinking a comically filled up glass of rose'.

## The choice

Let‚Äôs consider the choice. If you do nothing, it means that you believe that the act of killing a person is wrong no matter what the outcome is. This makes you a **Deontologist**, and you belong to the school of Immanuel Kant.

Can you imagine Immanuel Kant introducing himself to people?

"Hi, my name is Immanuel... you know what let me write it down because the spelling is a bit challenging."

If instead you push the guy, you are a disciple of **Consequentialism**. You deem it moral to sacrifice a life if the benefit far outweighs the cost. This makes you belong to the school of Thanos.

![Horny now](thicc_thanos.jpg)

‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs your ethics platform like mister, uhm, Thanos?‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you for asking. My entire moral foundation is about getting these six stones, put them on a winter glove, snap my fingers and as a result kill fifty percent of the people. This will solve any sort of problems, really.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, let me get this straight. You are saying that you want to bring the world population back to what it was in **1974**, and this will fix things forever?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh... yes?‚Äù



So, Consequentialism, in its purest essence, is bullshit. But what about Deontology?

Well, with Deontology you judge something not by the outcome, but by the act itself, which is either inherently good or bad. This is the **Categorical Imperative** by Immanuel Kant. Again, I'm really happy that I'm writing this instead of speaking it.

Let me give you an example: lying is inherently bad, so you must **never** lie. Makes sense, right? But what if nazis ask you if you are hiding any jews?

![Are we really? Yes, actually](Nazis.jpg)

Ding dong.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning. We are nazis‚Äî as you can notice from the uniforms and the... uh... swastikas. We were wondering, and feel free to say no, but are you by any chance hiding any jews?‚Äù

‚ÄúUfffff. Well, yes. Since you are asking. There‚Äôs a whole family behind that fake wall. That‚Äôs too bad though because I was really fond of them, especially the little girl, always writing on her **diary**.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, no, we understand. Do you mind if we get in and, you know, apprehend them?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, sure. Hey, if it‚Äôs not too much of a bother, do you mind leaving the diary behind? I was thinking maybe I can publish it? Make some money?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, we really shouldn‚Äôt, but you know what? You can keep it. It‚Äôs our way of saying thank you for calling us.‚Äù

![](kant.jpeg)

<FigureLabel>Immanuel Kant. Strong pedo vibes.</FigureLabel>

So yeah that Immanuel guy was also kind of a cunt.

But it‚Äôs not even his fault, because this shit is hard. Life is **freaking hard**! We all strive to get rules that simplify Life, so that we don‚Äôt have to think so much all the time. But rules are weird. They work well until they don‚Äôt, and when they don‚Äôt, they fail so spectacularly that it becomes a whole thing!

Sure, turning the other cheek is admirable, but what if I am the heavy-weight champion? There, you made me lose the fight. Thank you, **Jesus**!

Of course, killing one person to save five seems **reasonable**, but what if that person is my mom, whom I love, which means that I don‚Äôt want her to die, or at least not yet?

And finally, lying to break up with someone is deplorable, but what if I really want to eat at one of those **Michelin** restaurants, and I don‚Äôt want to pay the bill?

![Yummie!](michelin.jpg)

It seems to me that Life is just a sequence of **shit choices**, with diminishing returns and no chance of winning.

And you know what, that‚Äôs ok.

We are not supposed to get good at Life. Where did we even get the idea, a Coca-Cola commercial?

Nowhere is written that we need to become Life experts. We are only supposed to do Life for a bit.

If you think about it, there isn‚Äôt even much time to do anything anyway. So watch a movie, order pizza, go out for a walk, and then make yourself a favor and just die.

And this is **philosophy** in a nutshell.

Although, me personally? I would definitely push the guy against the train. But that doesn't make me a consequentialist. I just happen to find murder extremely funny.
