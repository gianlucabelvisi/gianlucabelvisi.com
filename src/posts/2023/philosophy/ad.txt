During the past year i have

philosphers write as if they had a terrorist point a gun to their and tell them please write terribly
books summarizing the are possibly the boringest thing

So I thought, let's try to talk about philosophy as if it was a stand up routing, which is way more pleasant and only 10x times more difficult to write.

I will tell you all i know. It won't take long.
