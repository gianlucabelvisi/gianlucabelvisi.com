Please, take a few seconds of mindfulness and admire all the books that I have read in 2022. But, more importantly, would you take a look at the awesome CSS animation I painstakingly made...

<Books2022 background={"desk3"}/>

Isn't it impressive? The animation, I mean. And now that the code is written, I can use it for so many things. This blog will turn into spinning images so abruptly that you won't even remember that there was a non-spinning time.

...

Ok, this spinning is mildly annoying. Great, I basically wasted eight hours of coding that I could have used to stare at the ceiling.

Let's go with the standard static view...

-- Books in image form

## So, how did it go?

Not very well to be quite honest.

For the whole year, I have constantly been at least five books behind schedule. Every time I logged into Goodreads, I felt like a loser. In December, I had to break up from a relationship to find the time to meet the goal, which finally happened on New Year's Eve close to midnight while on the flu, which meant that I had no time to make a bucket list. Good.

Still, to reach the objective, I felt forced to read:
* Poetry
* Cooking books
* Art books
* Comics

So, not real books.

There's a few reasons for this lackluster performance.

First, not being in a pandemic limits significantly the possibility to read. Also, work was a thing. It was generally nice outside and I have travelled a lot.

Additionally, at the beginning of the year I have been involved with some crazy dating schedules (not to brag), while now my dating is way more normalized in its lack-thereofness. Again, not to brag.

So, it's very easy to blame me for almost messing up my goal, but it's way easier to blame...

last year I had the courage to speak Truth: audio books are books.
Now I am back with another truth bomb. Big books are books. (I was joking before.)
