Due to misinterpreting a passage of the bible, I ended up reading 52 books in [2020](/books-2020). Then expectations were formed, so I had to repeat the deed in [2021](/books-2021), although with different books.

At that point, I thought I might as well stick with it and read a book per week also in the year **2022** from the birth of **Baby Yoda**.

So let's rejoice and take a few seconds of **mindfulness** to visualize them books, and more importantly, would you look at the freaking awesome **CSS animation** I painstakingly made...

<Books2022 background={"desk4"}/>

Don't you find it **impressive**? The animation, I mean.

And now that the component is written (click [here](https://github.com/gianlucabelvisi/gianlucabelvisi.com/blob/master/src/components/blog/PhotoStack.js) for some code porn), I can reuse it on so many occasions. This blog will turn into **spinning** images so abruptly that you won't even remember that there was a non-spinning dark age.

The nineties are back!

Ok, this is mildly **annoying**. What was I thinking? I have wasted eight hours of coding that I could have used to stare at the ceiling!

Let's go with the analog view...

![A stream of booksness](goodreads.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Nope, common mistake.</FigureLabel>

You will ask, are we done?

Are there any more books to read or can we move on to something else like maybe buy a sports car and join those **illegal** street races, but also solve crimes because the car talks?

<small>(Note to self: reserve the rights to <strong>Car Gpt</strong>.)</small>
<p></p>

Well, according to my calculations, if no new books come out this year, we are almost there. Or at least I hope. I don't want to spend another year like this.

## Why, how did it go?

Not very well to be quite honest!

For the whole year, I have constantly been at least **five** books behind schedule. Logging into [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12362887-gianluca-belvisi) gave me intense vibes of being **pickled garbage**.

(If you are a regular reader of this blog, you might have noticed that I'm trying to make **pickled garbage** happen. I owe it to a dear friend.)

In early December, I had to **break up** üíî from a relationship so that I could find the time to reach the goal. There were also other problems.

I finally closed the circle on **New Year's Eve**, with the midnight approaching and while on the flu, which meant that I had no time to make a bucket list. So that's nice!

<Poll id="books-2022"
      question="How many books did you read in 2022?"
      answers={["Less than 5", "Less than 10", "Less than 30", "Less than 52", "52 or above"]}
      labels={["Cringe", "Not cool", "Based", "Noice", "Liar"]}
/>

Still, to meet the objective, I felt compelled to read:
* Poetry
* Cooking books
* Art books
* Comics

Also known as **not** real books.

</div>
<FigureLabel>That'll teach them!</FigureLabel>


There are a few reasons for this lackluster performance.

First, not being in a **pandemic** limits the possibilities to read, which is unfortunate.

Also, work was a thing, I increased my gym time, I tried and failed at meditation because it's the **boringest** thing ever, I once saw a cute dog, and it was generally nice outside. People were naked.

Speaking of, at the beginning of the year I have been involved in some **crazy** dating schedule that sucked out all my free time. Not to brag. While now my dating is way more normalized in its *lack-thereofness*. Again, not to brag. ü•≤

Based on the above, it's very easy to blame **myself** for almost messing up my goal, but it's **significantly** easier to blame...

## Elden Ring

![Elden Ringu](eldenring.jpg)

The masterpiece of **From Software**, notorious for making extremely difficult games whose stories require hours of [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@VaatiVidya) to make sense of them, dropped last March, and is responsible for the loss of at least a percentage point of **GDP**.

Written by George RR Martin, who would rather pen the menu of a family restaurant than finish **The Winds of Winter**, Elden Ring has stolen 130 hours of my life. Or should I say enriched? No, stolen.

![Good advice](tfbh.jpg)

<FigureLabel>If you know the game, this is very funny!</FigureLabel>

On day one from its release, I created a character named Paola, gave her a bitch resting face and made her strong in **magic**.

Then, about halfway through, I realized that magic is **op** in this game. *(For the normies, op means over-powered.)* Plus, JKR had gone about posting cringe on the twitter, so she became a bloody **c-word** assassin. I mean Paola, not JKR. Or at least not only.

![Le drip](drip.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Drip check: this is Paola before the class reassignment. Yes, she's not wearing any pants. Even if it penalizes her defense, I am a legs enthusiast. </FigureLabel>

But I digress. Let's go back to books.

## Smaller vs larger

![It's not the size that matters](size.png)

The smaller one is a novella about our sun fading out like a cigarette in the toilet. This compels Humanity to build gigantic rockets, attach them to the Earth, and propel the planet toward **Alpha Centauri**.

Basically, they had a **problem**, and they fixed it in 45 pages, which is kinda efficient!

The larger book is about extremely intelligent guy **Ray Dalio** reading the tea leaves of History and concluding that the western society is at the end of its cycle, and that we are going to have a **reset**.

Maybe the solution is to build gigantic rockets and attach them to the planet. This will become my answer for everything. ü§∑üèΩ

## Left hand of darkness

My favorite book of the year and quite possibly *years* is a sci-fi novel by **Ursula K. Le Guin**.

The story takes place on the planet of **Winter**, where the inhabitants are human-like beings known as *Gethenians*, who are unique in that they are ambisexual, meaning they have no fixed gender and are able to change between male and female depending on their sexual and social needs.

![Left Hand of Darkness](lhod.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Still of the theater adaptation. Fun fact. I had initially asked Dall-e to paint an illustration of the novel, and it kept drawing left hands in the snow. With seven fingers. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</FigureLabel>

The novel follows the journey of a human envoy, **Genly Ai**, who is sent to Winter to persuade its inhabitants to join a federation of planets. Throughout his journey, Genly struggles to understand and communicate with the Gethenians, and ultimately faces a crisis of identity as he grapples with the nature of humanity. But he also experiences one of the most beautiful friendships written on paper.

<small>And before you go all <strong>JKR</strong> on yours truly, the novel was written in 1969. So, it's not yet another danger to Society that scares you so much, something, something, woke culture, would someone think of the children.</small> <p></p>

What this novel is, is **splendidly written**. You read a sentence, and you are like omg this is wonderful. Let me read it again. Oh, and this other sentence is chef kiss, and this whole page, and this one, too. Am I crying?!

I wish I could have brain damage to read it again with an **oblivious** mind!

## Rendezvous with Rama

It's going to be **Denis Villeneuve**'s next film -- not sure if in between dunes -- so I was curious to read the original novel from **Arthur C Clarke**, which I enjoyed.

![The thing](rama2.jpg)

Stories about encounters with aliens are of two kinds.

Either they are **friendly** creatures who want to learn the language, play music, ride with you on a bicycle, or they are **cunty** xenomorphs that want to murder you, eat you, inseminate you. Not necessarily in this order.

**Rendezvous with Rama** reminds us that there is a third, possibly worse, option...

## Surely you are joking, Mr Feynman

Not only was **Richard Feynman** one of the greatest minds of the last century, but he had a unique talent for communicating complex ideas to the layperson. His lectures are a treasure of insight, and it's lovely seeing how much the audience is captivated.

<YouTube source={"EYPapE-3FRw"}/>

After reading his autobiography **Surely you are joking, Mr Feynman**, I found out that he was also a horny goofball!

Speaking of **horny**.

## Malenia

![This bitch](malenia.jpg)

nifiri crazy parry

## Philosophy

I'm currently busy writing a post about philosophy. Or rather I should say rewriting. This is because in the first draft I realized that I know very little about Philos I should prob read about it. Phi

![Plato](plato.jpg)


it's like *bro, who hurt you? Why are you like this?*

There are exceptions, and they are from people that are still alive and hence would not tolerate to be shamed on this blog, so they put an effort.

The following are two examples:

## The big picture

**Sean Carroll** is probably the best Science and Philosophy communicator. He's just a pleasure to listen to. Of course, this is because Richard Feynman has passed away in 1988. So I'm curious about Sean's whereabouts on February 15th of that year.

(To complete the list, I firmly believe that **Bill Nye** and **Neil Degrasse Tyson** belong to prison.)

**The big picture** is a book about Philosophy, and like all good Philosophy books should, it begins by talking about the subatomic, then it builds up and up until he reaches the point of asking what is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.

<small>If you are one of those people that say 42, I hate you so freaking much.</small><p></p>

By the way, Carroll provides the best answer to the (in)famous **trolley problem**. I will not spoil it here because it's going to go in the Philosophy post. Please wait until -- checks notes -- March.

## The fabric of reality

**David Deutsch** is the smartest person alive, and please don't say that name that is currently in your mind.

I have tried reading his book **The beginning of infinity** and I felt like, to properly understand it, I would need to write a blog post about it, or even a series, and as [Trello](/trello) shows, my slate is already filled. So we are looking at October for this.

In the meantime, I have read **The Fabric of Reality**, which is far more accessible. In this work, Deutsch attempts at unifying four theories:

1. Quantum theory
2. The theory of evolution
3. Epistemology (theory of knowledge)
4. Computational theory

In chapter 1, the Author establishes the **Multiverse** as an inevitability, and it's turtles all the way down.

## Big books

![big books](bigbooks.jpg)

Never been a big books kind of person. More an average book size and cup.

Sorry about the juvenile humor.


last year I had the courage to speak Truth: audio books are books.
Now I am back with another truth bomb. Big books are books. (I was joking before.)

## Why books?

## Conclusions
