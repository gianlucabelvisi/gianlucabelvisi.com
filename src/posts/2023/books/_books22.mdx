Due to misinterpreting a passage of the bible, I ended up reading 52 books in [2020](/books-2020). Then, since expectations were built, I repeated the deed in [2021](/books-2021), although with different books.

At that point, I thought I might as well eff around and read a book per week also in the year 2022 from the birth of **Baby Yoda**.

So let's rejoice and take a few seconds of **mindfulness** to visualize them books, and more importantly, would you look at the freaking awesome **CSS animation** I painstakingly made...

<Books2022 background={"desk4"}/>

Don't you find it **impressive**? The animation, I mean.

And now that the component is written (click [here](https://github.com/gianlucabelvisi/gianlucabelvisi.com/blob/master/src/components/blog/PhotoStack.js) for some code porn), I can reuse it for so many occasions. This blog will turn into **spinning** images so abruptly that you won't even remember that there was a non-spinning dark age.

The nineties are back!

Ok, this is mildly **annoying**. What was I thinking? I have wasted eight hours of coding that I could have used to stare at the ceiling!

Let's go with the analog view...

![A stream of booksness](goodreads.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Nope, common mistake.</FigureLabel>

You will ask, are we done? Are there any more books to read or can you move on to something else like maybe you could buy a sports car and join those **illegal** street races, but also solve crime because the car talks?

<p></p>

Well, according to my calculations, we are almost there. Or at least I hope. I don't want to spend another year like this!

<Poll id="books-2022"
      question="How many books did you read in 2022?"
      answers={["Less than 5", "Less than 10", "Less than 30", "Less than 52", "52 or above"]}
      labels={["Cringe", "Not good", "Based", "Noice!", "Liar"]}
/>

## So, how did it go?

Not very well to be quite honest.

For the whole year, I have constantly been at least **five** books behind schedule. Logging into [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12362887-gianluca-belvisi) gave me intense vibes of being pickled garbage.

(If you are a frequent reader of this blog, you might have noticed that trying to make **pickled garbage** happen. I owe it to a dear friend.)

In early December, I had to **break up** from a relationship so that I could find the time to reach the goal. There were also other problems.

I closed the circle on **New Year's Eve**, with the midnight approaching and while on the flu, which meant that I had no time to make a bucket list. So that's nice!

Still, to reach the objective, I felt compelled to read:
* Poetry
* Cooking books
* Art books
* Comics

Also known as not real books.

</div>
<FigureLabel>Gottem!</FigureLabel>


There are a few reasons for this lackluster performance.

First, not being in a **pandemic** limits significantly the possibilities to read, which is unfortunate. Also, work was a thing, I increased my workout time, I once saw a cute dog, and it was generally nice outside. People were naked.

Speaking of, at the beginning of the year I have been involved with some **crazy** dating schedule. Not to brag. While now my dating is way more normalized in its lack-thereofness. Again, not to brag. ü•≤

So, it's very easy to blame **myself** for almost messing up my goal, but it's **significantly** easier to blame...

## Elden Ring

![Elden Ringu](eldenring.jpg)

The masterpiece of **From Software**, notorious for making extremely difficult games, dropped last March, and it's been the obsession of several players and, hum, readers.

Written by George RR Martin, who would rather write the menu of a family restaurant than finish **The Winds of Winter**, Elden Ring stole 130 hours of my life. Or should I say enriched? Jury is out.

![Good advice](tfbh.jpg)

<FigureLabel>If you know the game, this is very funny!</FigureLabel>


I created a character, named her Paola, and made her strong in **Magic**. Then, JKR spewed a bunch of hideous ideas via The Twitter, and I changed her into a **bloodthirsty** assassin. I mean, my character, not JKR.

![Le drip](drip.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Drip check: this is Paola before the class reassignment. Yes, she's not wearing any pants. It penalizes her defense, but I really like legs. </FigureLabel>

But I digress. Let's go back to books.

## Smaller vs larger

## Philosophy



![Plato](plato.jpg)

writing a post about philosophy. I should prob read about it. Phi

it's like *bro, who hurt you? Why are you like this?*

There are exceptions, and they are from people that are still alive and hence would not tolerate to be shamed on this blog, so they put an effort.

The following are two examples:

## The big picture

Sean Carroll is probably the best Science and Philosophy communicators, and this is said by one that believe that Bill Nye and Neil Degrasse Tyson belong to prison.

By the way, Carroll provides the best solution to the (in)famous Trolley Problem. I will not spoil it here. Please wait for my post in -- checks notes -- March.

## The fabric of reality

David
* Quantum theory
* The theory of evolution
* Epistemology (theory of knowledge)
* Computational theory

The Author establishes the Multiverse in chapter 1 as an inevitability, then it proceeds to wild ride us

## Big books

![big books](bigbooks.jpg)

Never been a big books kind of person. More an average book size and cup.

Sorry about the juvenile humor.


last year I had the courage to speak Truth: audio books are books.
Now I am back with another truth bomb. Big books are books. (I was joking before.)

## Why books?
