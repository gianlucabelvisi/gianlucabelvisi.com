Due to misinterpreting a passage of the bible in a **drunken** haze, in [2020](/books-2020) I ended up reading 52 books. Then, since everyone was expecting a similar outcome, I repeated the deed in [2021](/books-2021), although with different books.

At that point I thought I might as well fuck around and read a book per week in the year 2022 from the birth of **Baby Yoda**.

So let's rejoice and take a few seconds of **mindfulness** to visualize them books, and more importantly, would you look at the freaking awesome **CSS animation** I painstakingly made...

<Books2022 background={"desk4"}/>

Don't you find it impressive? The animation, I mean.

And now that the code is written (find it [here](https://github.com/gianlucabelvisi/gianlucabelvisi.com/blob/master/src/components/blog/PhotoStack.js) ), I can reuse it for so many things. This blog will turn into **spinning** images so abruptly that you won't even remember that there was a non-spinning dark age.

The nineties are back!

Ok, this is mildly **annoying**. What was I thinking? I have wasted eight hours of coding that I could have used to stare at the ceiling!

Let's go with the analog view...

![A stream of booksness](goodreads.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Nope, only books.</FigureLabel>

You will ask, are there any more books to read or can we move on to something else like maybe you could buy a sports car and do one of those illegal street races while at the same solving crime because the car talks?

<p></p>

Well, according to my calculations we are almost there. Or at least I hope. I don't want to spend another year like this!

<Poll id="books-2022"
      question="How many books did you read in 2022?"
      answers={["Less than 5", "Less than 10", "Less than 30", "Less than 52", "52 or above"]}
      labels={["Cringe", "Lazy AF", "Somewhat based", "Noice!", "Liar"]}
/>

## So, how did it go?

Not very well to be quite honest.

For the whole year, I have constantly been at least five books behind schedule. Every time I logged into [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12362887-gianluca-belvisi), I felt the warm embrace of anxiety.

In early December, I had to **break up** from a relationship to find the time to meet the goal. There were also other problems.

which finally happened on New Year's Eve close to midnight while on the flu, which meant that I had no time to make a bucket list. Good.

Still, to reach the objective, I felt forced to read:
* Poetry
* Cooking books
* Art books
* Comics

So, not real books.

            frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
</div>

There's a few reasons for this lackluster performance.

First, not being in a pandemic limits significantly the possibility to read. Also, work was a thing. It was generally nice outside and I have travelled a lot.

Additionally, at the beginning of the year I have been involved with some crazy dating schedules (not to brag), while now my dating is way more normalized in its lack-thereofness. Told you: not to brag 🥲

So, on one side it's very easy to blame me for almost messing up my goal, but it's way easier to blame...

## Elden Ring

GRRM would rather write the menu than finish his books.

## Philosophy



![Plato](plato.jpg)

writing a post about philosophy. I should prob read about it. Phi

it's like *bro, who hurt you? Why are you like this?*

There are exceptions, and they are from people that are still alive and hence would not tolerate to be shamed on this blog, so they put an effort.

The following are two examples:

## The big picture

Sean Carroll is probably the best Science and Philosophy communicators, and this is said by one that believe that Bill Nye and Neil Degrasse Tyson belong to prison.

By the way, Carroll provides the best solution to the (in)famous Trolley Problem. I will not spoil it here. Please wait for my post in -- checks notes -- March.

* Quantum theory
* The theory of evolution
* Epistemology (theory of knowledge)
* Computational theory

The Author establishes the Multiverse in chapter 1 as an inevitability, then it proceeds to wild ride us

## Big books

Never been a big books kind of person. More an average book size and cup.

Sorry about the juvenile humor.


last year I had the courage to speak Truth: audio books are books.
Now I am back with another truth bomb. Big books are books. (I was joking before.)

## Why books?
