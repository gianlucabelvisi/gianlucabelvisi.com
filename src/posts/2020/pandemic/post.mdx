It seems that society is going to fall and we will all die soon, but on the plus side, we don't have to commute to work for a few weeks.

I'm not sure that this is the best time to panic. Yes, life will become more complicated, alienating and upsetting, but it doesn't have to be over-complex, irritating and absurd. We can be Westworld Season 1 without being Westworld Season 2!

With this in mind, I'd like to provide some comments and pieces of advice to make your existence more bearable and your domestic seclusion less of a drag, so that you don't lose your mind once and for all.
