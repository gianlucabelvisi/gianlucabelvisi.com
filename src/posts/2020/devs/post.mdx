If you are anything like me, you are obsessing over quantum mechanics.

You are spending your social distancing days trying to solve the double-slit experiment, possibly in its 'delayed choice quantum erasure' variant, which trolls us by showing that Reality is broken and I don't know why we as a Society aren't investing all of our resources in solving the mystery.



So, what is the solution to the experiment, then? Maybe we should follow the Copenhagen interpretation, that simply says don't think about it. Are you thinking about it? Stop!

Maybe we should all reconvene under the Pilot Wave theory, which removes Probability from the picture because Probability is weird and it makes our noses bleed.
Or should we go for the Many Worlds interpretation, explaining that every time we experiment, we are splitting the universe in two, which is bonkers, but it also kind of makes sense as we are living in weird times, possibly the result of too many splits?

Speaking of bonkers, what about that theory that says that what makes the wave function collapse is human consciousness? ðŸ§ 
As Richard Feynman said: "I cannot define the real problem, therefore I suspect there is no real problem, but I'm not sure there is no real problem."
If all this is not alien to you, you should watch Devs.

Devs is a mini-series airing on Hulu / HBO Nordic / Torrent, written by Alex Garland, the mind behind Ex Machina, Annihilation... The Beach?

It contains all of the above, plus Nick Offerman, Jesus, and the ultimate question: do we have free will or are we living in a deterministic world?
Or is it worlds?

The whole show plays out as a really good Black Mirror episode. It's elegant, well acted and shot, and doesn't exactly hold your hand, so if you are easily distracted by Pinterest, well at least it has a good score.


If you want to know more about quantum mechanics, this book is a great entry-level.

Now that you have watched these videos, your Youtube algorithm will suggest more quantum theory content and less Toss a coin to your Witcher covers, which was the ultimate goal.


Final comment about the title: Devs. That's kind of a shit title, isn't it? Seems like yet another silicon valley sit-com.

    In one of the later episodes, the

    And I was like: "Uhm... Defives? What does it even mean?!

    Turns out he meant that the v is a u, as in Deus.

    So I was like ah ok that makes more sense and tbqf not a bad title.
