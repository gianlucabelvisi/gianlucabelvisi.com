At the start of a game, **chess** offers you 20 possible moves: 16 pawn pushes and 4 pesky knight hops. Which feels manageable.

But by the 4<sup>th</sup> turn, things escalate so quickly that you now have **85 billion** combinations to choose from. Like in Life.

And exactly as in Life, an overwhelming majority of these options are complete and utter **rubbish**. We are talking growing a mullet levels of rubbish. Drinking milk after 11:00am, subscribing to Netflix, breaking spaghetti in half, enjoying the works of Ryan Reynolds. Just the nadir of horrible decisions in a wasteland of **free will**.

So, as a self-proclaimed **Life enthusiast**, a couple of months ago I dove into the world of chess, eager to apply its hard-won lessons to my daily grind, which has occasionally seen its share of H4s.

Well, am I any good? Not at all!

Which is why on November 3rd I travelled to Stockholm and squared against **Gotham Chess** and **Anna Cramling**, i.e. the biggest chess YouTuber and the cutest. I'm still talking about Gotham.

## But why?

This part comes at the end, for effect.

## The hosts

With nearly six million subscribers amassed in under five years, **Gotham Chess** has become one of the most recognizable figures in the chess community, and deservedly so. He is, of course, a talented player, but his success relies primarily on his ability to be both informative and entertaining. Gotham possesses a rare, **improvisational** gift for delivering unedited, 30-minute streams of consciousness packed with insightful game analysis and witty humor, which is a breath of fresh air in a landscape dominated by heavily edited content.

The daughter of two chess grandmasters, **Anna Cramling** started playing chess at just three years old. Her success as a content creator stems largely from her genuine enthusiasm for the game and her approachable, lighthearted style, which makes chess accessible to players of all levels.

Plus, she has this Swedish matter-of-fact way of saying things, like:

<Dialogue>Now, this is a really bad move.</Dialogue>

...that one can't help but find endearing.


## The event

During the second part of the event, I and other 59 lucky holders of VIP tickets, challenged Gotham and Anna to a simultaneous game, where the hosts hop from board to board taking turns.

Only, to speed things up, Anna's parents, Pia and Jose', both Grand Masters, also joined in. So you understand that we had no chance.


## The game

## Opening


In all this, my Apple Watch kept notifying me with a:

<Dialogue>Hey, are we ok?</Dialogue>

Apparently, my heart was behaving as if I was running for my life, while being completely still. This is what happens when you force yourself out of your comfort zone and do something so inadequately outrageous.

Or maybe this was only due to Anna asking me if I was Finnish.
