import {Dialogue} from "../../../components/blog/Text";


At the beginning of a game, **chess** has you choose between 20 possible moves: 16 pawn advancements plus 4 pesky knights -- which is manageable.

But already at the fourth turn, things escalate so quickly that you now have **85 billion** combinations to choose from. Like in Life.

And exactly as in Life, an overwhelming majority of those moves are complete and utter **rubbish**. We are talking about growing a mullet levels of rubbish. We are talking about drinking milk after 11:00 am, breaking the spaghetti in half, enjoying the works of Ryan Reynolds. Just... wow.

So, as a **Life enthusiast**, a couple of months ago I have started playing chess eager to transfer the knowledge accrued there onto my daily grind, which has had its share of H4s.




Now, am I good at it? Not exactly! Which is why on November 3rd I have travelled to Stockholm and played against **Gotham Chess** and **Anna Cramling**, i.e. the biggest chess YouTuber and the cutest. (I'm still talking about Gotham).

## But why?

This bit comes toward the end, for effect.

## The hosts

With more than 5 million subscribers, Gotham Chess and rightly as he has an innate talent in teaching chess to beginners and commenting on games with tremendous insight, while being funny, and in a single stream of consciousness instead of a heavily edited video that less talented YouTubers need to rely on in order to retain attention.

Anna Cramling is rapidly getting thanks to her there has a genuine enthusiasm for the craft and her Swedish matteroffactly way of saying things like...

<Dialogue>Now, this is a really bad move.</Dialogue>

...that one can't help but finding endearing.

## The event



## Opening

During the second part of the event, I and other 59 lucky holders of VIP tickets, challenged Gotham and Anna to a simultaneous game, where the hosts hop from board to board taking turns.

Only, to speed things up, Anna's parents, Pia and Jose', both Grand Masters, also joined in. So you understand that we had no chance.

In all this, my Apple Watch kept notifying me with a:

<Dialogue>Hey, are we ok?</Dialogue>

Apparently, my heart was behaving as if I was running for my life, while being completely still. This is what happens when you force yourself out of your comfort zone and do something so inadequately outrageous.

Or maybe this was only due to Anna asking me if I was Finnish.
