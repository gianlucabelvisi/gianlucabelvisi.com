import {Dialogue} from "../../../components/blog/Text";

At the start of a game, **chess** graciously offers you 20 possible moves-- 16 pawn pushes plus 4 pesky knights -- which feels manageable.

But by turn four, chaos ensues, as you are now facing 85 billion possible combinations. Just like in Life.

But already at the 4<sup>th</sup> turn, things escalate so quickly that you now have **85 billion** combinations to choose from. Like in Life.

And exactly as in Life, an overwhelming majority of these options are complete and utter **rubbish**. We are talking growing a mullet levels of rubbish. Drinking milk after 11:00am, subscribing to Netflix, breaking spaghetti in half, enjoying the works of Ryan Reynolds. Just the nadir of shit choices in a wasteland of free will.

So, as a self-proclaimed **Life enthusiast**, a couple of months ago I dove into the world chess, eager to apply its hard-won lessons to my daily grind, which has seen its fair share of H4s.

Well, am I any good? Not at all!

Which is why on November 3rd I travelled to Stockholm and squared against **GothamChess** and **Anna Cramling**, i.e. the biggest chess YouTuber and the cutest. I'm still talking about Gotham.

## But why?

This part comes at the end, for effect.

## The hosts

With nearly 6 million subscribers collected in under five years, GothamChess has become one of the most recognizable figures in the chess world, and deservedly so. Not only is he an exceptionally skilled player, but he has a rare talent for teaching beginners and analyzing games with tremendous insight, all while being genuinely funny. His style is raw and polished at the same time, offering a dense of information stream of consciousness, rather than the highly edited content that less gifted YouTubers rely on to hold viewers' attention.

Anna Cramling is rapidly getting thanks to her there has a genuine enthusiasm for the craft and her Swedish matteroffactly way of saying things like...

<Dialogue>Now, this is a really bad move.</Dialogue>

...that one can't help but finding endearing.

## The event

During the second part of the event, I and other 59 lucky holders of VIP tickets, challenged Gotham and Anna to a simultaneous game, where the hosts hop from board to board taking turns.

Only, to speed things up, Anna's parents, Pia and Jose', both Grand Masters, also joined in. So you understand that we had no chance.


## The game

## Opening


In all this, my Apple Watch kept notifying me with a:

<Dialogue>Hey, are we ok?</Dialogue>

Apparently, my heart was behaving as if I was running for my life, while being completely still. This is what happens when you force yourself out of your comfort zone and do something so inadequately outrageous.

Or maybe this was only due to Anna asking me if I was Finnish.
