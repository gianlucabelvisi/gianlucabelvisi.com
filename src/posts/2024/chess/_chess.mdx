At the start of a game, **chess** offers you 20 possible moves: 16 pawn pushes and 4 of those pesky knight hops. Which feels manageable.

![Easy peasy](opening.png)

But by the 4<sup>th</sup> turn, things escalate so quickly that you now have **85 billion** combinations to choose from. Like in Life.

And exactly as in Life, an overwhelming majority of these options are complete and utter **rubbish**. We are talking growing a mullet levels of rubbish. We are talking drinking milk after 11:00am, wearing Birkenstocks in October, breaking spaghetti in half, enjoying the works of Ryan Reynolds. Just the nadir of horrible decisions in a wasteland of **free will**.

So, as a self-proclaimed **Life Enthusiast** or at the very least Life Customer, a couple of months ago I dove into the world of chess, eager to apply its hard-won lessons to my daily grind, which has occasionally seen its share of H4s.

Well, am I any good? Not at all!

Which is why on November 3rd I travelled to Stockholm and squared against **Gotham Chess** and **Anna Cramling**, i.e. the biggest chess YouTuber and the cutest. I'm still talking about Gotham.

## But why?

This part comes at the end, for effect.


## The hosts

With nearly six million subscribers amassed in under five years, **Gotham Chess** has become one of the most recognizable figures in the chess community. Deservedly so. He is of course a talented player, but his success relies primarily on his ability to be both informative and entertaining. Gotham has an **improv-like** gift for delivering unedited, 30-minute streams of consciousness packed with insightful game analysis and witty humor, which is a breath of fresh air in a market of heavily edited content.

The daughter of two chess grandmasters, **Anna Cramling** started playing chess at just three years old. Her success as a content creator stems largely from her genuine enthusiasm for the game and her approachable, lighthearted style.

Anna talks with her hands as if she was Italian, and at the same time employs this typically Swedish matter-of-fact way of saying things, like:

<Dialogue>Now, this is a really bad move.</Dialogue>

...that one can't help but find endearing.


## The show

Held at a venue by the King's Garden in central Stockholm, the event kicked off with a lively **Guess the Elo segment**, where two hosts commented on games submitted by the audience.

I was relieved that my contribution didn't make the cut, as it was a **blunder** fest that left me with three queens on the board while still having to rely on the enemy king seppukuing himself.

The evening continued with a Q&A session, which combined heartwarming moments with a mix of **drama** commentary. It seems like every human discipline must have conflict. Really makes you think.

As the first part of the event wrapped up, the hosts reflected on how remarkable it was to see such a **turnaround**. Not long ago, they noted, it would have been unthinkable to pack a full theater for a chess event-- i.e. a game that is admittedly as exciting as watching a soccer match, a formula 1 race, or grass growing.

So, for the turns having tabled and chess now enjoying widespread interest, we must be thankful to the **pandemic**.

*(To be fair, the hosts didn't say this. I threw it in to spice things up and keep you engaged.)*

## The game

Then, we moved to playing the game, which is where shit got real.


Plan was for the hosts to entertain a round of simul-chess, whereas they play against me and other 59 holders of VIP tickets, hopping from table take turns to move.

Only, to speed things up, Anna's parents, Pia and Jose', both Grand Masters, also joined in.

So you understand that i had no chance.


In chess, opening, mid game, end game....

## Opening

I spent the whole train ride to the capital deciding my opening, as it's so importnant. I ended up choosing the King's Indian Defense because it's the only one I know.

Develop my pieces, move to defended positions, watch them diagonals, castle.

The day after, I input the same opening moves into stockfish and the machine laughed at me.

King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men
	2.	Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
	3.	Protector of the Realm
	4.	The Conqueror


Two moves later, i blunder my knight to Gotham's turn, because when I'm the kind of person that, on the first day in prison, likes to be punched in the face by the first inmate to


## Mid game

In all this, my Apple Watch kept notifying me with a:

<Dialogue>Hey, are we ok?</Dialogue>

Apparently, my heart was behaving as if I was running for my life, while being completely still. This is what happens when you force yourself out of your comfort zone and do something so inadequately outrageous.

Or maybe this was only due to Anna asking me if I was Finnish.

## End game

<Dialogue>I think you have one move left.</Dialogue>

## Ok, but why?
