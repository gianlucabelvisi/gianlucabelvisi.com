At the start of a game, **chess** offers you 20 possible moves: 16 pawn pushes and 4 of those pesky knight hops. Which feels manageable.

![Easy peasy](opening.png)

But by the 4<sup>th</sup> turn, things escalate so quickly that you now have **85 billion** combinations to choose from. Like in Life.

And exactly as in Life, an overwhelming majority of these options are complete and utter **rubbish**. We are talking growing a mullet levels of rubbish. We are talking drinking milk after 11:00am, wearing Birkenstocks in October, breaking spaghetti in half, enjoying the works of Ryan Reynolds. Just the nadir of horrible decisions in a wasteland of **free will**.

So, as a self-proclaimed **Life Enthusiast** or at the very least Life Customer, a couple of months ago I dove into the world of chess, eager to apply its hard-won lessons to my daily grind, which has occasionally seen its share of H4s.

Well, am I any good? Not at all!

Which is why on November 3rd I travelled to Stockholm and squared against **Gotham Chess** and **Anna Cramling**, i.e. the biggest chess YouTuber and the cutest. I'm still talking about Gotham.

## But why?

This part comes at the end, for effect.


## The hosts

With nearly six million subscribers amassed in under five years, **Gotham Chess** has become one of the most recognizable figures in the chess community. Deservedly so. He is of course a talented player, but his success relies primarily on his ability to be both informative and entertaining. Gotham has an **improv-like** gift for delivering unedited, 30-minute streams of consciousness packed with insightful game analysis and witty humor, which is a breath of fresh air in a market of heavily edited content.

The daughter of two chess grandmasters, **Anna Cramling** started playing chess at just three years old. Her success as a content creator stems largely from her genuine enthusiasm for the game and her approachable, lighthearted style.

![Anna Cramling](anna.png)

Anna talks with her hands as if she was Italian, and at the same time employs this typically Swedish matter-of-fact way of saying things, like:

<Dialogue>Now, this is a really bad move.</Dialogue>

...that one can't help but find endearing.


## The show

Held at a venue by the King's Garden in central Stockholm, the event kicked off with a lively **Guess the Elo segment**, where two hosts reviewed games submitted by the audience.

I was relieved my contribution didn't make the cut, as it was a **blunder** fest that left me with three queens on the board, while still relying on the enemy king seppuku-ing himself.

The evening continued with a Q&A session, blending heartwarming moments with some **drama** commentary. It seems that no human endeavor is complete without a slice of conflict. Really makes you think.

![The show](show.jpg)

As the first part of the event wrapped up, the hosts reflected on how remarkable it was to see such a **turnaround**. Not long ago, they noted, it would have been unthinkable to pack a full theater for a chess event-- i.e. a game that is admittedly as thrilling as watching a soccer match, a formula 1 race, or grass growing.

So, for the turns having tabled and chess now enjoying widespread interest, we must be thankful to the **pandemic**.

*(To be fair, the hosts didn't say this. I threw it in to spice things up and keep you engaged.)*

<FigureLabel>Here I am playing on a giant chessboard and not, as it might first seem, shrinking down to Sardinian proportions to play on a standard-sized one.</FigureLabel>


## The game

During the second part of the event, I, along with 59 other VIP ticket holders, got the chance to challenge our hosts in a game of **simul-chess**.

For the **n00bs**, this is a format where a single player (or in this case, two) hops from table to table, playing White on all of them and making a move on each one while holding all **60 games** partially played in their mind.

Gotham and Anna gladly took on the task. However, to keep things moving at a reasonable pace, Annaâ€™s parents â€”- GM Pia Cramling and GM Juan Manuel BellÃ³n LÃ³pez -- stepped in to help.

So you must understand that I had **no chance**.

<FigureLabel>As his name length's suggests, Juan is originally from Spain.</FigureLabel>


A game of Chess is divided into **three phases**: the opening, the middlegame, and the endgame.

In the **opening**, you develop your pieces so they can work together while protecting your king -- ideally by castling. This is not the time for improvisation; you want to stand on the shoulders of giants and follow well-studied opening strategies instead of, say, growing a mullet.

If you survive the list of well-known traps that can end the game in just a few moves, congratulations â€” youâ€™ve made it to the **middlegame**! Here, youâ€™ll start crafting attack plans while sabotaging your opponentâ€™s. Pieces will be traded, blundered, or heroically sacrificed.

When enough pieces have been cleared and no checkmate is in sight, youâ€™ve reached the **endgame**. By now, the queen is probably gone, the king is strutting around being all misogynistic, and pawns are playing the game of thrones.

Let's see how it went for me...

![The setting](start.jpg)


## 1. Opening

Openings are so important that I spent the entire train ride to the capital deciding which one to use. In the end, I go for the **King's Indian Defense** because it's the only opening I know.

So, while my respectful opponents move their pieces in a **seemingly** random fashion, I develop my pieces based on theories Iâ€™ve absorbed from countless books. Or should I say Instagram Reels.

However, I can't help but **blunder** my knight to Gotham, because I'm the kind of person that, on their first day in prison, likes to be punched in the face by a random inmate to establish dominance, or lack thereof.

Be it as it may, we end up our opening in the following configuration...

![Opening 1](opening1.jpg)

Not too shabby, innit? The mayor is protected and I have plenty of **ideas** going forw-- just kidding, I'm in danger!

After the game, I fed my opening moves into Stockfish â€” the most powerful chess engine on the planet â€” and it laughed at me. I didnâ€™t even know that was possible.

Turns out that White had an **overwhelming** range of choice ahead, whereas Black basically brexited...


![Opening 2](opening2.png)

I'm King Harren the Black, barricading inside the impregnable castle that carries my name and feeling all **hygge** and shizz, while from the sky I'm about to be barbeque'd by **Aegon Targaryen** The Conqueror. First of his name. King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men. Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

*(It bothers me that I didn't need to look it up.)*


![Selfie](selfie1.jpg)

<FigureLabel>I took this selfie right after he got my knight. Stockholm Syndrome.</FigureLabel>


## 2. Mid-game

That said, I didn't travel first class and spent the night at a five stars hotel for **nothing**. I am determined to lose slowly, dragging my own **carcass** with as much dignity as I could muster.

I pay attention to every move and go **surgical**, ensuring protection of my pieces and preventing the White's attempts at forking attacks. In the entirety of the mid-game, I believe I have made one single mistake, which I commented to my opponent with a loud:

<Dialogue>BRO!</Dialogue>

You will ask: was it to Gotham? I wish! But it was to Pia. ðŸ™ˆ

<Dialogue>You are not giving up,<GlyphRight/> Gotham tells me a few moves later. <GlyphLeft/>Good!</Dialogue>

I want to reply with an <GlyphLeft/>I can to this all day!<GlyphRight/> but have a train to catch in one hour so I could not, in fact, have done this all day.

At some point Pia whispers: <GlyphLeft/>Fy fan.<GlyphRight/> Which is Swedish for <GlyphLeft/>I'm really enjoying this game!<GlyphRight/>

In all of this, my Apple Watch keeps asking me:

<Dialogue>Hey, are we ok?</Dialogue>

Apparently, my **heart** is pumping as if I was running from the police...

![Heart rate](health.jpg)

Which is what happens when you push yourself out of your **comfort zone** and do something so inadequately outrageous.

Or maybe this is simply due to Anna asking me if I am **Finnish**.

Speaking of, she declares: <GlyphLeft/>Let's spice things up<GlyphRight/> and triggers a flurry of trades that catapults us into the end game.


## End game

This is the **sorry ass** state of the board entering end game...

![Endgame 1](final1.png)

Can you see how my King is all but **surrounded** while their King completely lacks any form of surrounding?

**Stockfish** says that this is Mate in 4 for White. Also, I need to pee and have a train to catch in half an hour. I'm about to figuratively throw the towel when I see it. The move I have been waiting for. A final (more like first) attack to go out in style and bring the house down with me!

Can you see it?

![Endgame 2](final2.png)

Exactly. Queen D1 **check**!

With the pawn sniping G2, this leaves the King only one square to escape to. **Stockfish** is now fifty-fifty on us. Hypocrite. It loved White five minutes ago!

My strategy is crystal clear. This is what Iâ€™ve strived for all my years of playing chess (fine, weeks). I become **unstuck** in time. Nothing matter anymore. The train. The Pee. My entire life flashes in front of my eyes and I can't help but notice a mullet from ages 14 to 16.

After their King moves, I go Queen F1, then Queen G2 **check mate**!!!

![Endgame 3](final3.png)

However, I do not have two **consecutive** moves, do I? I didn't consider this.

Anna hops in, and after moving the King out of check, says:

<Dialogue>I think you have one move left.</Dialogue>

Classic Anna!

Can you guess White's next move?

![Endgame 4](final4.png)

It is of course Queen F3, which removes my mating aspirations and enables a descent south that will inevitably win the game.

I pick up my King, bring him to the backyard and shoot him in the face with a shotgun, as was customary back then.

        Given my recent <a href={"/diabetes"}>diagnosis</a>, this is exactly how I want to go.

With the King laying on the porch, there is only time to say thank you, shake hands, take a blurry selfie...

![Selfie 2](selfie2.jpg)

...then I'm off. What an experience!
