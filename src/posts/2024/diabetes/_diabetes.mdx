Meet Semola.

![Semola](./semola.jpg)

My sister found Semola in a parking lot when he was but a tiny furball, possibly abandoned by his mother because he was **ginger**.

    Remember kids that February is ginger awareness month. Please be kind to gingers and donate <a href={"https://paypal.me/gianlucabelvisi"}>here</a>.
</TextBox>

Semola doesn't purr, tuna gives him the bad poo-poo, and he enjoys capturing little **sparrows** that he then brings to my sister as token of appreciation, having confused her cries of horror for unabashed enthusiasm.

Last not least, this cat will be instrumental in my diagnosis. How? It shall all be explained.

Let's rewind time to January 2nd, 2024. I was visiting family and friends in Italy during the holidays and spending the last few days working remotely from my parents' home. My flight back to Sweden would be on the 4th.

Now, you need to understand that Semola loves to sit on my lap while I'm working, because sitting on my lap is truly a once in a lifetime experience, and hundreds of people would confirm.

<Poll
    id={"lap_sitting"}
    question={"How did you like sitting on my lap?"}
    answers={["It was a once in a lifetime experience!", "It was kinda mid", "I haven't sat on your lap yet"]}
    labels={["Loved it!", "Mid", "DM me"]}
/>

During my afternoon coding session, I realized that I had to pee, because in Italy we drink wine at lunch as if it's a normal thing, which it is.

But how could have I scooted Semola while he was enjoying himself so much? I mean, look at him.

I could have peed on an **empty water bottle**, but my company is not a 1 trillion dollar e-commerce organization, or at least not yet. So the next best option was using my **catholic** upbringing and endure it, exactly like Jesus our Lord on the cross.

Later in the evening, I was done with work, I had an appointment with a friend for fika (of the Swedish kind), and I also kinda had to pee real bad. So I gently asked Semola to bail and went to the bathroom to relieve myself.

Now, that was a long pee, and since I like to comment out loud on events that skew 5 sigmas beyond the mean, I told my mother:

<Dialogue>Now, that was a long pee.</Dialogue>

My mother took in the bit of information she received, spent a few seconds inferring, then replied:

<Dialogue>You have diabetes.</Dialogue>

![My mother](./house.png)

<FigureLabel>It's either that or Lupus.</FigureLabel>

So she insisted that I check my glucose levels. We had the measurement device at home because my mother has been a type 2 since the previous year, and my sister a type 1 since age 3.

Since it was easier to give in the request than debating the reasons for my Oppenheimer-level long urine, I prickled my finger (ouch!) to measure the bloody blood sugar.

The result was 22 mmol/L. To put it in context, the normal range is around 3-4 mmol/L and, beyond 28, organs severely deteriorate until you are mostly kinda dead.

While trying to process the enormity of the information, I remembered that I was supposed to meet a friend, so I texted her:

<Dialogue>Hey, so, I have to cancel our (swedish) fika because I have diabetes.</Dialogue>

Which, looking for silver linings, is a great excuse for anything.

<Dialogue>Listen, I can't come to your wedding because I have diabetes. Also, I don't wanna be invested in this union because I don't think it will last, and the reason I'm saying this is that I have eyes. But mostly diabetes.</Dialogue>

We go to the ER. The triage nurse acknowledges that it's not normal, but she says she has a queue of 50 people that exploded their fingers with fireworks on New Year's Eve, so she's like:

<Dialogue>Look, let's measure it again. If it's below 22, you go home and come back tomorrow.</Dialogue>

It was 25.

<Dialogue>You stay.</Dialogue>

## The Italian hospital

At the hospital, I have an amazing experience, except maybe for one detail. A doctor asked me how come I was at the hospital despite having no symptoms. I told him about the cat, the pee, the mother, and he replies:

<Dialogue>What was your mother even thinking? You should not get tested if you don't have symptom.</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Yeah, this bitch, am I right?</Dialogue>

I jest, of course because, I thought he was also joking, but then he repeated the same remarks two more times, so I no longer think he was. üò≠

Everything else was perfect and administered by kind personnel. I'm given insulin, glucose measure devices

<Dialogue>Hey soo, this all looks kinda expensive. Can it be a problem that I am de facto a guest here and that I have not paid taxes in Italy for the past 10 years?</Dialogue>

The nurse types in her desktop machine for some time, then:

<Dialogue>It seems like Italy still loves you, mr Belvisi.</Dialogue>

Well, of course. Italy has sat on my lap.
