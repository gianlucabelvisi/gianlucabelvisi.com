Meet Semola.

![Semola](./semola.jpg)

My sister found him in a parking lot when he was a tiny **furball**, possibly abandoned by his mother because he was **ginger**.

<TextBox title={"By the way"}>
    <p>Remember kids that February is <strong>ginger awareness month</strong>.</p>
    <BlogImage imageName={"ginger"} alt={"Ginger awareness month"} />
    <p>Be kind to the fellow <strong>soulless</strong> and donate <a href={"https://paypal.me/gianlucabelvisi"}>here</a>.</p>
</TextBox>

Semola refuses to **purr**, finds that tuna upsets his stomach, and has a thing for catching sparrows, which he then presents to my sister as tokens of affection, misinterpreting her cries of **horror** as manifestations of delight.

Lastly but not leastly, this cat will play a pivotal role in my **diagnosis**.

# Part 1: Diagnosis

Let's turn the clock back to **January 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024**.

I'm in **Italy** visiting family and friends for the holidays and wrapping up the final days working remotely from my parents' place. My flight back to Sweden is set for the 4<sup>th</sup>.

Semola has a particular **fondness** for sitting on my lap while I work. It's not just any lap he chooses. Mine is apparently a prime spot. A sweet piece of real estate. The ultimate chilling location. This is not at all surprising, as this sentiment is echoed by **countless** others who have been blessed with such an exclusive treatment.

<Poll
    id={"lap_sitting"}
    question={"How did you like sitting on my lap?"}
    answers={["It was a once in a lifetime experience!", "It was kinda mid", "I haven't sat on your lap yet"]}
    labels={["Loved it!", "Mid", "DM me"]}
/>

I'm the midst of an afternoon coding session ‚Äî or **pure bliss** as I like to call it ‚Äî with cat in tow, when I realize that I have to **pee**. A natural consequence of our Italian lunches, where sipping wine is part of the lore and **totally** not an addiction shut up.

But how could I possibly disturb Semola when he is so **contentedly** settled? I mean look at him...

![Semola on my lap](./lap.jpg)

And bear in mind that I don't have the possibility of peeing in an **empty water bottle** because my company is not a trillion-dollar corporation, or at least not yet, so the next best option is to recall my catholic upbringing and **endure** it, exactly like Jesus our Lord and Savior did when a donkey sat on his lap (Matthew 23:12).

Later in the evening, I'm done with work and have an appointment with a friend for **fika** (of the Swedish kind). To the surprise of no one, I have to pee real bad. I gently move Semola so as not to disturb him...

<ResponsiveEmbed ratio={"16:9"} src={"https://gifer.com/embed/3P6t"}/>

...and sprint to the bathroom to relieve myself.

Now, that was a long pee, and since I like to comment out loud on events that skew **5 sigmas** outside the mean, I tell my mother:

<Dialogue>Now, that was a long pee.</Dialogue>

She welcomes the bit of **unsolicited** information, spends a few seconds pondering, then concludes:

<Dialogue>You have diabetes.</Dialogue>

![My mother](./house.png)

<FigureLabel>It's either that or Lupus.</FigureLabel>

You need to understand that mom is **absolutely** not a doctor. However, she might be a witch.

Since number one-ing for too long can be a sign of **high glucose** in the blood, she insists that I check my level with the measurement device we have at home, being her a fresh type 2 and my sister a type 1 since age 3. And understanding that it's simpler to comply than to discuss the reasons behind my Oppenheimer-level long urine, I prickle my finger like in a **satanic** ritual and measure my bloody blood sugar.

The result is **22 mmol/L**. To put it in context, the normal range is around 3-4 mmol/L and, beyond 28 mmol/L, organs severely **deteriorate**, until you are mostly kinda dead.

![Alternative cover](./cover_alt.png)

<FigureLabel>This is the first iteration on the cover image. It has a ginger cat in it, which I didn't ask for but I absolutely loved. When I directly told <strong>Midjourney</strong> to add a cat on my lap, it couldn't figure out the logistics. This is why we still need human artists. Just kidding, no cat is fine!</FigureLabel>

While processing the enormity of the information, I remember that I'm supposed to meet a friend, so I text her:

<Dialogue>Hey so I have to cancel our (swedish) fika because I have diabetes lol.</Dialogue>

Which, grasping at silver linings, is an **amazing** excuse that I can use for anything, replacing my previous and admittedly weaker: _I have a sore face_.

<Dialogue>Listen, I can't come to your <strong>wedding</strong> because I have diabetes. Also, I don't wanna be invested in a union I know it will not last, and the reason I'm saying this is that I have eyes. But mostly diabetes.</Dialogue>

My father drives me to the ER. The triage nurse acknowledges that this is not normal, but at the same time she has a queue of 50 people that **exploded** their fingers with fireworks on New Year's Eve, so she's like:

<Dialogue>Let's measure it again. If it's below 22, you go home and come back tomorrow.</Dialogue>

It's 25.

<Dialogue>You stay.</Dialogue>

![At the ER](./er2.jpg)

## The Italian hospital

At the hospital, I have an **amazing** experience. The personnel is at their most professional despite 50 **lunatics** running and screaming around the facility, with missing fingers and a blood trail.

The only **exception** is a nurse that asks me how come I measured my glucose despite having no symptoms. I tell her about the cat, the pee, the witch mother, and she comments:

<Dialogue>What was your mon even thinking? You should <strong>not</strong> have tested if you didn't have any symptoms.</Dialogue>

I **yes-and** on the obvious joke because, no matter how **dire** things are, I will **never** let a joke un-yes-anded:

<Dialogue>Yeah, this bitch, am I right?</Dialogue>

But then, during my stay, she **repeats** the same remarks two more times, so I am now inclined to think she was serious. üò≠

Be it as it may, they conclude that this is most definitely diabetes, with a high probability toward **type 1** because _look at you_. So I have this thing going now!

![](wbw.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Original image: <a href={"https://waitbutwhy.com/"}>Wait but why</a></FigureLabel>

I'm told that more analysis will be needed. I'm given an insulin stash, glucose measurement tech, and all sorts of **advice**, like not eating fika that much. Swedish.

Everything is administered with **kindness** and precision. Which gets me thinking...

<Dialogue>Hey soo, this all looks great but also expensive. Could it be a problem that I am <i>de facto</i> a tourist and that I have not, like, paid taxes in <strong>Italy</strong> for the past 10 years? Plus, I got a speeding ticket in <strong>Florence</strong> back in 2013 that at this point I just refuse to pay also due to Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's egregious treatment of <a href={"https://gianlucabelvisi.com/caterina-sforza-1"}>Caterina Sforza</a>, but I digress.</Dialogue>

The doctor types on her computer for a few beats, then says:

<Dialogue>It <strong>seems</strong> like Italy still loves you, signor Belvisi.</Dialogue>

Well, of course. Italy has sat on my lap. Sat on my lap **real** good.

## Interlude: Diabetes

But what is diabetes, anyway?

In **type 1** diabetes, imagine your pancreas as a Facebook friend that has been sharing conspiracy theories for a tad too long. Suddenly, you realize that his posts (insulin) are no longer showing up on your feed (bloodstream). This is because your immune system (Facebook) has decided to **shadow-ban** his ass, and now you have to go on his profile and manually like all the posts about the moon landing being faked by **Stanley Kubrick** so that he could get from NASA those juicy Zeiss f/0.7 lenses he used to shoot indoor candlelight scenes in **Barry Lyndon** (insulin injections).

![Barry Lyndon](barry.png)

<FigureLabel>Totally freaking <strong>worth it</strong></FigureLabel>

In **type 2** diabetes, imagine your pancreas as this lazy as fuck security guard...

<YouTube source={"ZN5xiCEsV5o?si=pj4XqdW-m0iF5C6d"} />

There is no certainty on why type 1 diabetes manifests. In part, it is **genetically** determined, but the trigger is unknown. It could be a virus, stress, fatigue, or using a microwave oven to warm up your panties.

There is indeed certainty on type 2. Your fondness for food, divided by your love for exercise, approaches **infinity**.


## The Swedish hospital

At the hospital, I have an **amazing** experience. The personnel is at their most professional, despite a **lunatic** running around the facility, having not yet figured out after 10 years that, in Sweden, the first floor is the ground floor. I'm talking about someone that is not me.

The only **exception** is a nurse who insists that we communicate in Swedish.

<Dialogue>You need to learn, so that you can <strong>become</strong> Swedish.</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Well, I'm already <strong>Swedish</strong>, so what you just said was really dumb.</Dialogue>

I reply using with my Swedish level of a **second-grader** with a learning disability, which adds to the irony, I think.

Then I get to meet the doctor who turns out to be amazing. She asks me what happened, I tell her about Semola, and upon request I show her a reel I made of him.

![Semola](./reel.png)

<FigureLabel>If you are a boomer you can click <a target={"_blank"} href={"https://www.instagram.com/p/CnCe-NpIr5k/"}>here</a></FigureLabel>

She conclude that this is most definitely diabetes, with a high probability toward **type 1** because I am very fit. I thank her despite not feeling in the mood for lap sitting. She adds:

<Dialogue>Anyway, you are in good hands here. Sweden is very advanced in the treatment of diabetes. In fact, the regions with the <strong>highest</strong> number of cases per capita are Finland, Sweden, and Sardinia.</Dialogue>

That raises an eyebrow.

<Dialogue>Oh, really? Wait... Sardinia?!</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>There we suspect the so called <strong>small island</strong> effect</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Is is a polite way of saying <strong>inbreeding</strong>?</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>...</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Well, don't get me started with <strong>Sardinians</strong>. Not only do they leave their region in search of opportunities in Italy, but they are so obnoxious in telling us how this is temporary, that nothing compares to Sardinia, be it climate, food, people, and I'm like why don't you and your defective genes eff off back to your Island and, like, bathe in your transparent waters, enjoy your high longevity life, grow your organic food, cook your juicy piglets, make love to your beautiful goats. But I digress.</Dialogue>

I'm told that more analysis will be needed. I'm given an insulin stash, glucose measurement tech that you attach directly to your skin and sends glucose data to your phone and, through your phone, it also forward it to the hospital, so that they can track in real time if you are alive.

![Thirst trap](./sensor.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Pardon the thirst trap</FigureLabel>

As in Italy, this is all **for free**, because in Europe we have this thing called **healthcare**. We recognize that the individual is not an island, but the integral part of a community. The higher taxation level ensures the help of those in need.

Then again, I'm not really paying taxes in Sweden, am I? I'm paying them in **Denmark**. Let's keep this between us.

<YouTube source={"OtIZL1U49G8"}/>

<FigureLabel>Sound on</FigureLabel>

The doctor also tells me that there is currently an ongoing study in Lund's University Hospital looking into halting the deterioration of the pancreas in newly diagnosed type 1s. Would I be interested in participating? Heck yeah!, I say.

But then I'm reminded about the Lund's students I have hung out with and their drinking habits, so here is hoping that I will end up in the control group!

## Conclusions

As you can imagine, this was a whole thing!

But is this traumatic? Should you feel bad for me? Should I feel bad for myself? Absolutely not! It's not what happens to you but how you-- wait, let's hear it from Gandalf...

<YouTube source={"2jC-rRPKZ3U?si=PL0L0hvZjbRw0hkt&amp;start=9"}/>

<FigureLabel>Ignore the part when they talk about jewelry. The metaphor detaches there.</FigureLabel>

And for what is worth, I'm keeping my chin up, spirits high, and I'm not letting this get to me.

![The big lie](./chat.jpg)

This is where I should end the post, but I can't. The thing is, I have told you a huge fucking lie because, you see, internally I'm **malding**.

# Part 2: Malding

    <p><i>From mald +‚Äé -ing, itself a blend of mad +‚Äé bald.</i></p>

        ‚ÄúMalding‚Äù is a slang word used to describe an angry person.
        A combo of the words ‚Äúmad‚Äù and ‚Äúbalding,‚Äù ‚Äúmalding‚Äù refers to a person (often a gamer) who gets extremely heated and irritated about something (to the point where they could metaphorically
