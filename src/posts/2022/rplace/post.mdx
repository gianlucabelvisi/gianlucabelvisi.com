Imagine an empty canvas.

Everyone is allowed to paint colored **dots** on this surface, but each one can only add a dot every five minutes.

Given enough time, and provided that you don't have a life, you can manage to complete a simple but satisfying **drawing**, but here's the catch:

* The canvas is only going to be available for four days

* Other people can paint dots over your own dots ü¶Ñ

So, what do you do? Possibly nothing! The only winning move is not to play. Just hop onto the next thing, like that dress that might be blue or gold.

## Blue, by the way

But there's something in **human people** that you can't find in other species, and that has allowed them to evolve, and reach top of the food chain, while cats and cauliflowers are stuck on square one. They form communities.

Humans find patterns. They identify elements in common with others and gather around those abstract concepts to become **Legion**.

What these communities share is often preposterous, like being born inside a certain geo-fenced radius called Country. Other times, they feel a belonging due to a heartfelt passion, like sports ‚õ∑, cooking ü•ò, hentai porn üêô.

Together, humans can achieve the impossible, like painting on a shared canvas one dot at a time. Or can they? This is exactly the experiment carried out by the sub-reddit [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/), which just concluded.

Having been one of the **four million** people that contributed to it, I feel a bizarre sense of pride in showing you the end result...

<FigureLabel>Click the image for the details. Can you find Wally?</FigureLabel>

Even though it's the end result that is going on my wall as a 80x80cm print, it's not what matters. What matters is the **frenemies** that we made along the way.

See if you can detect some high-stakes drama in this timelapse...

Did you notice Americans and Turks destroying each others **flags** several times until the US decided to move to the opposite side of the canvas?

Or how quickly **penises** were drawn and erased?

Or the Germans waking up all of a sudden and tracing a horizontal iron curtain with their flag? Imagine how much **real estate** they had to steal from other groups and how hard they had to fight to keep it. Germans.

Speaking of which...

## Ukraine

As you can image, **Ukraine** has received strong support from many allies and a prominent position on the top left quadrant.

![](ukraine.jpg)

At some point, President **Zelensky**'s face was ruined. I wonder who did it? üßê

Well, the community brought it back with extra added coolness.

<iframe id="reddit-embed" src="https://www.redditmedia.com/r/place/comments/twoi5y/what_doesnt_kill_you_gives_you_drip/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share&amp;embed=true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" style="border: none;" height="336" width="640" scrolling="no"></iframe>

## Italy

Much respect for the **Italians** working together at some of the best national representations. I helped with the coffee, because of course I did.

![](italy.jpg)

I think that **Dante Alighieri** sitting over the Portugal sign is really cute, and it's hilarious how Mexico is stealing our thunder a bit. Although it's sad not to see my hometown **Pisa**.

Ah no, wait. It is there...

![](pisajpg.jpg)

It's a bit far from the rest of Italy, right next to **Nelson Mandela** and **Mass Effect**.

Are they trying to say that Pisa doesn't exist, and it's just a [Mandela Effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-mandela-effect-4589394)?

## Sweden

I have to say that, after seven years, **Sweden** remains a mystery to me.

![](sweden.jpg)

## France

Excellent work from France. They fought one the most gruesome battles when their **Tour Eiffel** was torn down and replaced by a giant butt hole, symbolizing I believe the **Vichy** puppet government.

But they rebuilt. And while they had to cede land when people got the idea of adding the **Windows 7** bar at the bottom of the Canvas, they lost so that we all could win.

![](france.jpg)

Admittedly, I don't know much of French culture. Who's the shush guy? What's going on with Hermione? Is the lo-fi hip-hop girl French? Why Pokemons? Isn't that arc from **Elden Ring**?

## Joke countries

Poor **Canada**. While France and Ireland were building and drinking, Canadians struggled to draw their own leaf...

<iframe id="reddit-embed" src="https://www.redditmedia.com/r/place/comments/tw9xn9/timelapse_of_canada_struggling_to_make_a_leaf_for/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share&amp;embed=true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" style="border: none;" height="621" width="640" scrolling="no"></iframe><p></p>

Although to be fair, foreign agents were probably sabotaging them. Now that I think of it, I was one of the folks that wanted to replace the leaf with a **banana**.

Of course, Germans, with their superior organizational skills, had to rub it in...

## Drama

This is political streamer **Hasan** ordering an assault on political streamer **Destiny**.

Destiny reacted by sending his army against Hasan's dead dog. üê∂

## Kinda sus

The **Among Us** characters are hidden everywhere, like literally. ‡∂û
![](amongus.png)

![](amogus.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Hint: the pill, the bicycles, Spike's hair, the smoke/cloud, Z-event-- And this is but a tiny piece of the whole canvas</FigureLabel>

## Art

Some incredible work that makes you wonder whether bots were used. Like here...

![](art1.jpg)

And here...

![](art2.jpg)

And finally here...

![](starwars.jpg)

...and I'm really talking about the Jedi ducks.

## Then poof

At the end of the fourth day, r/place just fizzled away in a sea of void, while people were still placing their dots, refusing to wake up and holding on the final seconds of a good dream...

<iframe id="reddit-embed" src="https://www.redditmedia.com/r/place/comments/twnvqq/my_world_is_ending/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share&amp;embed=true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" style="border: none;" height="621" width="640" scrolling="no"></iframe><p></p>

If you go to [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) now, you will only find a blank canvas and the echoes of the people that were there for the fight. One pixel at a time.

They'll tell you their stories of broken friendships, great victories, death and rebirth, but deep down they know that you **normies** won't fully understand. You had to be there.
