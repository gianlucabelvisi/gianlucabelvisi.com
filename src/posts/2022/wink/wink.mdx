So, is anybody tired of all those jokes about how terrible 2020 was?

Wait, you are?! Oh, shit— I did not expect that— Honest to god I thought that 2020 jokes were going to be fine for at least five more years!

Ok, no problem, I’ll improvise something. How hard can it be? Sooo… what’s the deal with the post office, am I right? They ask you to lick the stamps, and I’m like, really? During a pandem— FUCK!

You know, to be completely honest, my worst year wasn’t even 2020. It was 2019. In early 2019, my grandma died and— you know, it’s ok, she was 94.
Whenever I tell people that my grandma died, they are like “Awww”, and I feel bad for making them feel bad. So I tell them that she was 94 and they are like “Oh, well then good riddance! Why did you even tell us? Screw the old lady. We hope she died in pain!”

Now, in hindsight, considering what was about to unfold, dying in 2019? Excellent choice, Anna!

A few months after my grandma died, I was assaulted. It happened at night time. I’m walking home and somebody punches me from behind, making me smash my face onto the ground. This one? It’s not my original face. It comes from a donor. Yeah, I’m not happy either.

And the worst part is that this aggression was completely unprovoked. The assault had no motive whatsoever. Although when this occurred I was listening to a podcast, so I’m not saying that I’m blameless.

What else happened in 2019? Ah yeah, my laptop was stolen. It happened at nighttime, when I was punched by a stranger from behind and— oh, there’s the motive right there.

And last not least, I broke up with my long time relationship. Or rather I should say that she broke up with me, if you are a glass half empty kind of person.

So, 2019 has been for me a continuous series of punches, some of which literal, and by that I mean that my ex used to beat me.

Still, I’ve tried my best to keep my chin up. I recall that, at the end of 2019, on new year’s eve, I patted myself in the back, saying hang in there, buddy! 2020 is gonna be way better for you—

And don’t get me wrong, it was!

One thing that I like to do every time I break up with someone, is to go through a grief phase. Since break ups make me conclude that I’m a worthless piece of shit, I take the chance to behave like one. So in this phase, I completely isolate from the outside world, always wearing sweat pants, always working from home, and the rare times I go outside, like for groceries, since I don’t want people to have their day ruined by looking at my shit face, I cover it with a face mask.

So that was 2020 in a nutshell for me, and I have to say I was relieved to see that I wasn’t the only one going through such a phase.

Then, one day I decided that my apartment was too dirty and I was ready to move on— to a new apartment. But I was also like let’s take some time off, so I went on a vacation to Sicily, where my family is from. And that’s where I met her.

Let me picture the scene for you. I’m driving around town on a Vespa like a freaking cliche, when I notice this woman working at the gas station. She’s suntanned, with long dark curly hair, wearing a work unitard like Super Mario, but underneath you could notice this sexy red swimsuit bra, much unlike Super Mario.

So not only is she insanely hot, but more importantly, given her profession, one might infer that she’s not what you would call smart.

And there I am thinking if only I had an excuse to talk to her! Which is when I realize that I’m literally sitting on a motor vehicle that drinks more than a porn star.

With that in mind, I drive a circle around town and approach the gas station again. Only, now there are three cars queuing at the pump. And maybe I overreact a bit, because I become convinced that I cannot wait in line, because any of these three guys — if not all of them! — have an opportunity to score a date with her before me.

So I formulate my master plan. I would jump the queue with my Vespa, drive past the woman, look at her in the eyes, and when she looks back at me, I would wink at her.

<beat>

That’s it. That’s my master plan. Were you waiting for more?

Now, I know what you are thinking, but you need to understand that, in Sicily, winking at women is a perfectly acceptable form of communication. It’s not sexual assault, or at least not yet.

In my mind, after my winking, she would become so infatuated that she would tear down her unitard and jump on my Vespa. I would drive toward the sunset, with her hands holding my body, and her hard nipples pinching my back. Ouch, do you mind?

Now — spoiler! — that’s not how things went, so let’s rewind to me jumping the queue, driving toward her, locking eyes with her, and winking with my left eye — which is important as I can’t really wink with my right eye — you see? It looks like I having a stroke, and this, I’m told, is not sexy.

So, when I winked at her — and I need to remind myself that the past of wink is ‘winked’, and not ‘wank’. I do not masturbate in front of strangers, thank you very much, because they cancel you for that, and it’s also a shitty thing to do.

So when I winked at her, she had exactly no reaction whatsoever. She looks at me driving by, then she returns to filling the fuel tank, and this utterly destroys me.

I would have understood if she had reacted with disgust, because then I’d know it, she’s not into men, what can you do?

But no reaction? That’s the worst reaction! It means that I make zero impact in this world. I am but a worthless piece of shit, a subhuman non-person that’s not supposed to go around winking at strangers. I should be home instead, wearing sweatpants, watching tv shows, crying myself to sleep!

And when I come to this realization, I’m starting to feel relieved. I no longer have to exchange words with strangers in order to procure happiness. I no longer need to feel bad for being alone and dirty. My life is so much simpler now. I’m finally free, and this is worth celebrating by getting fucked up drunk!

So I park my Vespa in front of a bar and go inside. I reach the counter and order every entry in the menu. While I wait, I notice that on the wall behind the counter there’s a huge mirror, which makes the bar look bigger than it really is, and I’m like, great, now I have to see my ugly ass face. But you know what? It’s actually fine, because I don’t give a shit anymore. So I look at the mirror, and that’s when I realize that I’m wearing sunglasses.
