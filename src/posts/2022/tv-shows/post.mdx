TV shows. Am I right?

These last couple of years must have been the best for the **TV industry**, what with us sitting on our buttocks all day, gas prices making it expensive to drive cars toward destinations, and starving streaming services punching production companies with bags of money to create new content.

As a species, we seem to enjoy binging entire seasons until 3:00 AM on a work day, with **Netflix** politely asking: "Hey, real quick, are you still alive?" üôä

And I get it. Why **constrain** ourselves with a story that has a beginning, a middle, and an end, which effs off in two hours, when you can tell the same events by **spreading** them all over six seasons to maximize consumption?

It's not like we are busy or anything! And the longer we stare into the sea of pixels, the less we ponder about the **emptiness** of our existence.

<FigureLabel>God, give me the strength to look at my investments...</FigureLabel>

If I come across as **salty**, it's probably because I am!

I guess I've wasted too many hours on series that over-promised and under-delivered. If I could get that time back, I would use it to learn how to play an instrument, so that I could **seduce** people by the campfire with my sweet guitar skills, instead of **exhausting** them intellectually.

But good TV shows are possible! In this post, I'll share with you five **excellent** series that you should watch in 2022.

    <p><strong>Important Warning</strong>: This post also contains a <strong>spicy take</strong> on a beloved show that has just wrapped up and that I did not like.</p>
    <p>I ask you to read my opinions with an open mind. Initially, you will reject them. You will be mad at me, even. But let that sink in. Take a few thoughtful showers, then admit your mistakes, unwatch said program, and apologize to me by <a target={"_blank"} href={"paypal.me/gianlucabelvisi"}>sending money</a>.</p>

The shows are in no particular order because we are all **adults** here. Though, I did place the ones I like the most at the bottom, for effect, so I guess they are ordered after all. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## The Great

<YouTube source={"1sMrtt7sAR8"}/>
<TvCard seenOn={"Hulu"} seasons={"2"} ongoing={"yes"} emoji={"ü§¥üèªüë∏üèº"}/>

Set in **Russia** circa 18th century judging by the dress code, **The Great** follows the occasionally true story of Catherine, trying to overthrow her husband's reign of fear and incompetence, and replace it with her Enlightenment inspired reign of fear and incompetence.

(Remember kids, nobility is **cringe**, as they said back then. If at all possible, you should avoid it.)

If the show feels like the **adaptation** of a play, it's because it is. Most of the story takes place on one giant set, the casting is race blind, and the actors speak a mix of modern and *ye olde* English ("Nay means nay!"), instead of the language most commonly used by Russian nobles at the time: French.

Highlight of the whole production is **Nicholas Hoult** having the time of his life portraying a character that can switch from funny goofball to homicidal maniac on a dime, while always managing to be **delightful**.

He is truly a wonder to witness.

<ResponsiveEmbed ratio={"16:9"} src={"https://gfycat.com/ifr/EsteemedMadeupHammerheadshark"}/>

<FigureLabel>Did you get it? Because he was in that film?</FigureLabel>

If you liked **The Favourite**, this is more of that goodness.

(After my immersion in Russian literature [last year](/books-2021), and this show now, it seems to me that Russians are a bunch of interesting folks. I wonder what they are up to these days.)

## For All Mankind

Ronald D Moore has learned the ropes writing for **Star Trek**. Then, for his debut as a showrunner, he worked at **Battlestar Galactica**, which had a stupid story and ridiculous characters.

On his following project **For All Mankind**, he must have thought what if this time I write an intelligent story instead, and - hear me out! - compelling characters that have interesting arcs?

This turned out to be an excellent idea...

<YouTube source={"HZS9M52Bd_w"}/>
<TvCard seenOn={"Apple TV+"} seasons={"3"} ongoing={"yes"} emoji={"üöÄüåö"}/>

For All Mankind is set in an alternative timeline where the **Soviets** won the race to the Moon. This makes the Americans extremely **butt-hurt** as they go pedal to the metal into the space race, instead of getting bored with rocket launches as in our own darker timeline.

![Cringe as fuck](golf.jpg)

<FigureLabel>This photograph of astronaut Alan Shepard playing golf on the Moon was used as a political excuse to <strong>defund</strong> NASA, and it's probably why we haven't landed on Mars yet. Piece of shit ü¶Ñ</FigureLabel>

As a side effect to giving NASA **infinite money**, in the show's reality, technology advances a bit faster, republicans stay in power for longer and, for some reason, **John Lennon** is not murdered. Across the globe, the Soviet Union holds together to their common objective of maintaining space superiority, instead of falling in 1989 over the population's desire for Levi's jeans and soft drinks.

![](women.jpg)

<FigureLabel>The shows intelligently explains the introduction of women astronauts so early in the timeline compared to ours as a publicity stunt to match the Soviets. Say what you will about Communism, but women in that society were equal to men in every aspect, except politics</FigureLabel>

As you can imagine, establishing a base to the **Moon** is already a difficult endeavor in and of itself, but doing it in a world where the USSR is still a thing is even more challenging.

As a results, characters go through such hardships and have to face emergencies so big that they make you think how will they even survive this one? And sometimes the answer is: "Oh, they don't", which makes the times they do feel **earned**.

Best sci-fi show of the decade.

## Barry

<YouTube source={"M6TZdk1t8Zo"}/>
<TvCard seenOn={"HBO Max"} seasons={"3"} ongoing={"yes"} emoji={"üé≠ü•∑üèº"}/>

According to my napkin calculation, **Breaking Bad** was 70% drama and 30% dark comedy. Have you ever stopped considering what happens when you swap those numbers? You get **Barry** is what you get!

Titular Barry is a former Marine still a bit shell shocked for the whole **Afghanistan thing**. Back to the homeland, he is coached into making use of his particular set of skills by becoming a killer for hire.

While fulfilling a contract about murdering an actor, he discovers the joys of being on stage, decides to quit the murdering people career, and enrolls in the same acting class of the poor guy he had to dispose.

Of course, the old life keeps creeping up. Hilarity ensues.

![Humble bragging](acting.jpg)

<FigureLabel>If the idea of a killer being reformed by acting seems too unrealistic, I'd like to give my anecdotal testimony. As someone who has acted for a bit a life ago, I have hardly ever murdered anybody.</FigureLabel>

Set in Los Angeles, the show heavily parodizes the **Hollywood** scene. Actors, producers, drama teachers  are all self-absorbed, brain-dead, assholes.

And then there is Sally, played Sarah Goldberg, who has not a background in comedy, and still was able to deliver this incredible performance...

<YouTube source={"qw62N4v8Cwo"}/>

Conversely, the Chechen and Bolivian mob, who are supposed to be the bad guys, are all sweethearts, and they contribute to what is quite possibly my favorite dialogue exchange ever:

<Dialogue>"He killed my twin brother!"</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>"Dude, you need to let that go!"</Dialogue>

Anyway, speaking of Breaking Bad...

<SpicyTake>I didn't love Better Call Saul</SpicyTake>

Take this wonderful scene...

<YouTube source={"B33hKP5khGc"}/>

Initially, it's just two wine enthusiasts talking shop. Then, you understand the subtext: they are flirting!

And it's a kind flirting where boundaries are removed like onion layers ‚û° "Am I talking too much?" ‚û° "Not at all." ‚û° "Mr Fring..." ‚û° "Ah ‚úãüèøGustavo."

But then something happens and Gustavo leaves abruptly. We don't know why, but actually we do! Of course he cannot let another person in his life, not after what happened last time. üò≠


## Succession

<YouTube source={"OzYxJV_rmE8"}/>
<TvCard seenOn={"HBO Max"} seasons={"3"} ongoing={"yes"} emoji={"üë¥üèΩüíµüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ÄçüôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"}/>

Is it possible to love a story where every character is a piece of shit?

With **Succession**, you can easily imagine the notes that a lesser network would provide:

"You need at least a likable character that the audience can identify with."

So, in the Multiverse there must be a version of this show where Kendall Roy is trying to take away a dying company from a senile father and his toxic siblings.

This would have been a lesser version of this show. It's important for Succession to be choke full of detestable characters, because something happens along the way. You start seeing these people not as villains, but as broken beings.

Of course, the reason why someone would develop toxic personalities are multi-varied and require tons of intros- it's the parents' fault!

Take for instance Siobhan Roy. She is self-absorbed and manipulative.

Take this incredible dialogue with her mother. These are two adults that are making good points, and at each exchange have the possibility of throwing an olive branch and mend their relationship, but instead they choose to hurt each other.

Finally, look at Siobhan's face when her mother drops **the bomb**...

<YouTube source={"bp0gvV_8C84?start=61"}/>

How would you react if your mom told you that she should have never had kids? üò≠ And how can you despise Siobhan after this?

The best written TV show since **The Wire**.

## The Rehearsal

Do you know who **Nathan Fielder** is? If not, I envy you so much because you are now open to the comedic genius that is **Nathan For You**, a show that starts with a simple premise of helping real businesses, and goes into wild places.

For his next project, Nathan must have thought what if Nathan For You had a budget? The result is The Rehearsal...

<YouTube source={"2fjPFt8cpic"}/>
<TvCard seenOn={"HBO Max"} seasons={"1"} ongoing={"yes"} emoji={"üè†üìπ"}/>

The first episode, involving a man wanting to tell the truth to a friend, establishes the format and defines the russian doll structure similar to Synecdoche, New York.

The second episode pushes the envelope further, with a woman rehearsing motherhood on a multi week endeavor, with child actors of increase age.

By the end of the second episode, the format breaks a bit already, with Nathan deciding to be more actively involved in the rehearsal. This spirals in a personal process of questioning fatherhood, lying to people to get by, living with the consequences of one's actions.

With these kind of shows that involve real people, you never fully know how much of this is either staged entirely, assembled through the magic of editing, or is simply people yes-anding Nathans's ideas.

But toward season end, something happens that is definitely real, as it involves a six-year-old child, and which fall precisely into the season's theme, and that is frankly heartbreaking.

I also have found myself wondering if I could be a good dad, or I should at this point say "could have been".

Nathans personal arc already hit very close to home, but this particular event and the way it was handled had me in tears.

Truly a master work of improvisation, careful organization, and true open heart examination of the self. It will be studied in schools.
