TV-Shows. Am I right?

These last couple of years must have been the best for the TV industry, what with us sitting on our buttocks all day, gas prices making it difficult to justify using a car to go to the theater or the grocery shop, and streaming services punching production companies with bags of money to create new content.

We seem to enjoy binging entire seasons until 3am, with Netflix periodically asking "Hey, real quick, are you still alive?" 🙊
I mean, why limit ourselves with a story that has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that effs off in two hours, when you can spread it all over six seasons with unnecessary inserts and then remember to wrap all up with a bunch of good final episodes?

It's not like we are busy or anything! And the more we stare into the sea of pixels, the less we ponder about the emptiness of our existence.



## The Great

<TvCard seenOn={"Hulu"} seasons={"2"} ongoing={"yes"} emoji={"🤴🏻👸🏼"}/>

Set in Russia circa 18th century judging by the dress code, **The Great** follows the occasionally true story of titular Catherine, trying to overthrow her husband's reign of fear and incompetence, and replace it with her enlightenment inspired reign of fear and incompetence.

(Remember kids, nobility is **cringe**, as they said back then. If at all possible, you should avoid it.)

If the show feels like the adaptation of a theater play, it's because it is. Most of the story takes place at the royal palace, it has a race blind casting, and actors speak a mixture of modern and *ye olde* English ("Nay means nay!") instead of the language most commonly spoken by Russian nobles at the time: French.

Highlight of the whole production is **Nicholas Hoult** having the time of his life portraying a character that can switch from funny goofball to homicidal maniac while always managing to be delightful.

He is truly a wonder to witness.

<FigureLabel>Did you get it? Because he was in that film? This was, hum, a joke I just came up with.</FigureLabel>

If you liked **The Favourite**, this is more of that goodness.

After my personal immersion in Russian literature of [last year](/books-2021), and this show now, it seems to me that Russians are a bunch of interesting folks. I wonder what they are up to these days.

## The Rehearsal

Do you know who **Nathan Fielder** is? If not, I envy you so much because you are now open to the comedic genius that is **Nathan For You**, a show that goes into wild places.

For his next project, Nathan must have thought what if Nathan For You had a budget? The result is The Rehearsal...

## Succession

Is it possible to love a story where every character is a piece of shit?

With **Succession**, you can easily imagine the notes that a lesser network would provide:

"You need at least a likable character that the audience can identify with."

So, in the Multiverse there must be a version of this show where Kendall Roy is trying to take away a dying company from a senile father and his toxic siblings.

This would have been a lesser version of this show. It's important for Succession to be chocke full of detestable characters, because something happens along the way. You start seeing these people not as villains, but as broken beings.

Of course, the reason why someone would develop toxic personalities are multi-varied and require tons of intros- it's the parents' fault!

Take for instance Sioban Roy. She is self absorbed and manipulative.
