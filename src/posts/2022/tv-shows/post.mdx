TV shows. Am I right?

These last couple of years must have been the best for the TV industry, what with us sitting on our **buttocks** all day, gas prices making it difficult to justify using a car to go to the theater or the grocery shop, and streaming services punching production companies with bags of money to create new content.

We seem to enjoy binging entire seasons until 3am, with Netflix periodically asking "Hey, real quick, are you alive?" 🙊

I mean, why limit ourselves with a story that has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that effs off in two hours, when you can spread it all over six seasons with unnecessary inserts and then remember to wrap all up with a bunch of good final episodes?

It's not like we are busy or anything! And the more we stare into the sea of pixels, the less we ponder about the emptiness of our existence.

IMPORTANT WARNING

This post also contains a very spicy take about a beloved TV show. I ask you to read my opinions with an open mind, then admit your mistakes and unwatch said program.


## The Great

<TvCard seenOn={"Hulu"} seasons={"2"} ongoing={"yes"} emoji={"🤴🏻👸🏼"}/>

Set in Russia circa 18th century judging by the dress code, **The Great** follows the occasionally true story of titular Catherine, trying to overthrow her husband's reign of fear and incompetence, and replace it with her enlightenment inspired reign of fear and incompetence.

(Remember kids, nobility is **cringe**, as they said back then. If at all possible, you should avoid it.)

If the show feels like the adaptation of a theater play, it's because it is. Most of the story takes place at the royal palace, it has a race blind casting, and actors speak a mixture of modern and *ye olde* English ("Nay means nay!") instead of the language most commonly spoken by Russian nobles at the time: French.

Highlight of the whole production is **Nicholas Hoult** having the time of his life portraying a character that can switch from funny goofball to homicidal maniac while always managing to be delightful.

He is truly a wonder to witness.

<FigureLabel>Did you get it? Because he was in that film? This was, hum, a joke I just came up with.</FigureLabel>

If you liked **The Favourite**, this is more of that goodness.

After my personal immersion in Russian literature of [last year](/books-2021), and this show now, it seems to me that Russians are a bunch of interesting folks. I wonder what they are up to these days.

## For All Mankind

Ronald D Moore has learned the ropes writing for Star Trek. Then, for his debut as showrunner, he rebooted Battlestar Galactica, which was an interesting sci-fi show with a stupid story and chokefull of ridiculous characters.

On his following project For All Mankind, he must have thought what if this time I write an intelligent story instead, and - hear me out! - with compelling characters that all have interesting arcs?

That turned out to be a great idea...

For All Mankind is set in an alternative timeline where the Soviets won the race to the moon.

This makes the americans extremely butthurt as they go pedal to the metal in funding NASA, instead of getting bored by rocket launches as in our own timeline.

## Barry

<TvCard seenOn={"HBO Max"} seasons={"3"} ongoing={"yes"} emoji={"🎭🥷🏼"}/>

**Breaking Bad** was 70% drama and 30% dark comedy. Have you ever stopped considering what happens when you swap percentages? You get **Barry** is what you get!

Titular Barry is a former Marine that is shell shocked from the whole Afghanistan thing. Back to the homeland, he is coached into making use of his particular set of skills by becoming a killer for hire.

Then, while in the process of fulfilling a contract about murdering an actor, he discovers the joys of being on stage, decides to quit the hitmaning people career, and enrolls in the same acting class of the poor guy he had to kill.

Of course, the old life keeps creeping up.

<FigureLabel>If the premise of the show seems to unrealistic, I'd like to give my anecdotal testimony that, having acted for a bit a life ago, I have hardly ever murdered anybody.</FigureLabel>

## Succession

<YouTube source={"OzYxJV_rmE8"}/>
<TvCard seenOn={"HBO Max"} seasons={"3"} ongoing={"yes"} emoji={"👴🏽💵🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏽‍♂️‍🙋🏽‍♀️"}/>

Is it possible to love a story where every character is a piece of shit?

With **Succession**, you can easily imagine the notes that a lesser network would provide:

"You need at least a likable character that the audience can identify with."

So, in the Multiverse there must be a version of this show where Kendall Roy is trying to take away a dying company from a senile father and his toxic siblings.

This would have been a lesser version of this show. It's important for Succession to be choke full of detestable characters, because something happens along the way. You start seeing these people not as villains, but as broken beings.

Of course, the reason why someone would develop toxic personalities are multi-varied and require tons of intros- it's the parents' fault!

Take for instance Siobhan Roy. She is self-absorbed and manipulative.

## The Rehearsal

Do you know who **Nathan Fielder** is? If not, I envy you so much because you are now open to the comedic genius that is **Nathan For You**, a show that goes into wild places.

For his next project, Nathan must have thought what if Nathan For You had a budget? The result is The Rehearsal...
