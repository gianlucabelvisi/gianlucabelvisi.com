I love taking showers.

First of all, they keep you clean, which is important now more than ever. But it also allows me to spend some qualiy time with my thoughts, which I really appreaciate. Hands down the best 45 minutes of my day.

Sometimes, these thoughts are the inception for an idea, a post, an monologue. Other times, they are simply collected back in the drain.

Warning: this post also contains a NSFW picture of myself, but it's hidden by a spoiler box, so it is actually safe for work if you resiste the urge of tapping the box to reveal the content, which I'm not entirely sure you can.

But let's start small...
Some of these thoughts get to become something more. Some already did.
