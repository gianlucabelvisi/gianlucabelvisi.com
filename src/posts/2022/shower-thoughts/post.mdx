Intro. I love taking showers, first it keeps you clean, plus it allows to wander in thoughts. Easily my favorite 45 minutes of the day.

Some of these thoughts get to become something more. Some already did.

Atoms in the universe.

Bill Gates.

## Free Will

Is there free will.

## Bruce Wayne

Beard.

## You don't have to put up with shit

Story of moles.

Partners.
