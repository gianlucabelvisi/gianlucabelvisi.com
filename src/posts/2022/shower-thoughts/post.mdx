I love taking showers.

First of all, they keep you clean, which is important now more than ever. But it also allows me to spend some qualiy time with my thoughts, which I really appreaciate. Hands down the best 45 minutes of my day.

Sometimes, these thoughts are the inception for an idea, a post, an monologue. Other times, they are simply collected back in the drain.

Warning: this post also contains a NSFW picture of myself, but it's hidden by a spoiler box, so it is actually safe for work if you resiste the urge of tapping the box to reveal the content, which I'm not entirely sure you can.

But let's start small...
Some of these thoughts get to become something more. Some already did.

## The Universe

The Universe is 13.8 billion years old. Let me repeat it for effect. 13.8 **billion** years. And that's last time I checked, so it's probably 14 by now.

It's fair to say that the Universe is quite big, but how much stuff is in it? Well, the number of atoms in the unverse is 10 Â´82, or a hundred billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion atoms, give or take.

Now, this might seem like a lot, but is it enough? I ask because it always seems that we have enough, until we don't.

For instance, in 1991 Bill Gates said that 640KB of RAM are more than anyone will ever need. Well, today my 32GB beg to disagree being all sweaty spaghetti while editing a holiday video.

So, I hope that we can make do with those 10Â´82 atoms, because that's all we get. It's not like we can open up the Universe and add more atoms as we do with RAM.

Seems like the Universe is an Apple product.

(By the way, Bill Gates denies that 640KB comment, but how can we believe a guy that is putting vaccines in our 5G?)
