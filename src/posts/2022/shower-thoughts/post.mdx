I love taking showers.

First of all, they keep you clean, which is important now more than ever. But it also allows me to spend some qualiy time with my thoughts, which I really appreaciate. Hands down the best 45 minutes of my day.

Sometimes, these thoughts are the inception for an idea, a post, an monologue. Other times, they are simply collected back in the drain.

Warning: this post also contains a NSFW picture of myself, but it's hidden by a spoiler box, so it is actually safe for work if you resiste the urge of tapping the box to reveal the content, which I'm not entirely sure you can.

But let's start small...
Some of these thoughts get to become something more. Some already did.

## The Universe

The Universe is 13.8 billion years old. Let me repeat it for effect. 13.8 **billion** years. And that's last time I checked, so it's probably 14 by now.

It's fair to say that the Universe is quite big, but how much stuff is in it? Well, the number of atoms in the unverse is 10 ¬¥82, or a hundred billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion atoms, give or take.

Now, this might seem like a lot, but is it enough? I ask because it always seems that we have enough, until we don't.

For instance, in 1991 Bill Gates said that 640KB of RAM are more than anyone will ever need. Well, today my 32GB beg to disagree being all sweaty spaghetti while editing a holiday video.

So, I hope that we can make do with those 10¬¥82 atoms, because that's all we get. It's not like we can open up the Universe and add more atoms as we do with RAM.

Seems like the Universe is an Apple product.

(By the way, Bill Gates denies that 640KB comment, but how can we believe a guy that is putting vaccines in our 5G?)

## Free Will

Is there free will.

## Bruce Wayne

that Bruce Wayne cannot really grow a beard, you know? Because the moment he does, well then Batman will also have a beard, and people will be like ‚ÄúWait a minute!‚Äù

## You don't have to put up with shit

Story of moles.

Partners.


## Bruce Wayne (reprise)

Something about Bruce Wayne has been bugging me for a long time, and I think I can now put my finger on what it is.

Have you noticed how Bruce Wayne always shows up at charities with a different date, but he‚Äôs never in a relationship?

And we are talking about stunningly attractive supermodels. But Bruce does not seem to be interested in them, and I get it, because this is all a pantomime. Bruce Wayne is the mask. He's playing a character who acts like a less problematic version of Leonardo di Caprio. He does that to protect his real identity, of a utility belt wearer vigilante.

But then, does he lie to these women?

Does he ask them out, being all flirty-flirty, have them fall in love, and then dump them? This seems extremely out of character, which is why I have developed the theory that, for these events, Bruce Wayne hires prostitutes.

Granted, this goes way deeper, because any decent journalist would easily run a background check and reach the conclusion that Roxy is not really a debutante.

No, there must be a carefully executed operation behind, where said prostitutes are hired years in advance. They are paid laser surgeries to remove their tattoos. They are sent to college. Fake documents are forged, accents are crafted through speaking and acting classes, and strings are pulled for them to have a career as actors, models, or nuclear scientists.

This is something that must take a lot of time and resources to accomplish, and I can imagine that the whole initiative is being led by Alfred.

So, when a subject is ready, she is activated, and gets to date Bruce Wayne for a few nights while the paparazzi take pictures.

I don‚Äôt even think that he has sex with them. He doesn‚Äôt strike me as that kind of guy. Though I‚Äôm not sure about Alfred.


## Solving Chess

When a game is left to the last 7 pieces, Chess is solved. The way Chess is solved is that we have calculated all the possible move sequences with any 7 pieces left, in any position. So it's not an AI thing. We just know the optimal moves. These are stored in an archive that is XXX MB. You can download it. Commit it to memory.

So, what if we add a piece? Can we solve chess when it's down to any last 8 pieces? Of course we can, but we need to pay around 5 million dollars per year in cloud storage.

With this in mind, can we solve Chess? Can we map all possible combination for 32 pieces, and hence be done with this sport and leave a bunch Russians out of job?

Unfortunately, it's not possible. We cannot build the flash storage that contains all the permutations because there aren't enough atoms in the Universe.

I told you we were gonna run out of them!
