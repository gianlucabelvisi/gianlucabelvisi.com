I love taking showers.

First of all, they keep you clean, which is important now more than ever. But it also allows me to spend some qualiy time with my thoughts, which I really appreaciate. Hands down the best 45 minutes of my day.

Sometimes, these thoughts are the inception for an idea, a post, an monologue. Other times, they are simply collected back in the drain.

Warning: this post also contains a NSFW picture of myself, but it's hidden by a spoiler box, so it is actually safe for work if you resiste the urge of tapping the box to reveal the content, which I'm not entirely sure you can.

But let's start small...
Some of these thoughts get to become something more. Some already did.

## The Universe

The Universe is 13.8 billion years old. Let me repeat it for effect. 13.8 **billion** years. And that's last time I checked, so it's probably 14 by now.

It's fair to say that the Universe is quite big, but how much stuff is in it? Well, the number of atoms in the unverse is 10 ¬¥82, or a hundred billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion atoms, give or take.

Now, this might seem like a lot, but is it enough? I ask because it always seems that we have enough, until we don't.

For instance, in 1991 Bill Gates said that 640KB of RAM are more than anyone will ever need. Well, today my 32GB beg to disagree being all sweaty spaghetti while editing a holiday video.

So, I hope that we can make do with those 10¬¥82 atoms, because that's all we get. It's not like we can open up the Universe and add more atoms as we do with RAM.

Seems like the Universe is an Apple product.

(By the way, Bill Gates denies that 640KB comment, but how can we believe a guy that is putting vaccines in our 5G?)

## Free Will

Is there free will.

## Bruce Wayne

that Bruce Wayne cannot really grow a beard, you know? Because the moment he does, well then Batman will also have a beard, and people will be like ‚ÄúWait a minute!‚Äù

## I don't have to put up with any of this

Since I was a kid, I've always had an incredible amount of moles scattered throughout my body. What us gingers lack in Soul, we compensate with moles.

This has been a significant psycological problem for me. Was I ever bullied for it? Not even once. Did I as a kid pre-bully myself by avoiding sports that required to be in a shared changing room in anticipation of a bullying that never took place? Yep!

That was, in retrospect, a mistake. üôà

With age, wisdom also came. I just stopped making it such a big deal, and eventually I stopped thinking about it entirely. I was also blessed by partners that never seemed to mind, so that helped a lot.

Then, early this year, I recall taking a shower, looking at my body at thinking wow, I have certainly come a long way since I was young, but at the same time, I don't have to put up with any of this! This stuff can be fixed! It's good that I fix it now, when it's a problem that I have overcome already, leveled up and all.

With this righteous conviction, I select the five moles I liked the least (James, Matthew, Susan, Ralph, and Bruno. Yes, I have named them. You don't?), then I book an appointment to a laser surgery place.

I show up there and while about to tell the receptionist which moles are to go, I receive a revelation. I don't have to put up with any of this! Like, nothing at all!

It's time for me to look less like a dalmatian and more like Fist of the North Star meets rapper 50 Cent.

"You know what?" I tell the receptionist. "Let's take a more radical approach. Let's nuke from orbit!"

She doesn't understand the reference, so she's not the one. I clarify. "Let's get rid of all of them. At least those in the front torso. Next year, we take out the ones on the back, then we do legs and shoulders, and if at the tail end of this I don't get a free anal bleaching, I'm gonna be real pissed."

"Ok, this we can do", she replied. "But it's going to be expensive and excruciatingly painful."

"Coincidentally, my middle name is Expensive and Excruciatingly Painful", I said. My mom could not be persuaded with any other option.

I enter the room where the laser operator shoots up people for money. The laser operator was hot and did not speak the language of the colonizer. During one of the last sessions around February, she tells me: "It's important that you don't expose the affected area to the sun". She said it in Swedish, which I understood. ü•≥

I was like: "Sure thing. But, hum, what about in July? Can I suntan by then?" I said it in Swedish, which she understood. üéä

In response, she laughed at me in Swedish, which I understood. üò≠ "More like July next year, lmao!"

So here I am, surrounded by naked people and sporting an SPF protection of plus infinity, also called t-shirt.

So if I were to add a corollary to the moral prescription "I don't have to put up with any of this", it would be something like "But maybe check the consequences first, you lousy piece of shü¶Ñ".


## Bruce Wayne (reprise)

Something about Bruce Wayne has been bugging me for a long time, and I think I can now put my finger on what it is.

Have you noticed how Bruce Wayne always shows up at charities with a different date, but he‚Äôs never in a relationship?

And we are talking about stunningly attractive supermodels. But Bruce does not seem to be interested in them, and I get it, because this is all a pantomime. Bruce Wayne is the mask. He's playing a character who acts like a less problematic version of Leonardo di Caprio. He does that to protect his real identity, of a utility belt wearer vigilante.

But then, does he lie to these women?

Does he ask them out, being all flirty-flirty, have them fall in love, and then dump them? This seems extremely out of character, which is why I have developed the theory that, for these events, Bruce Wayne hires prostitutes.

Granted, this goes way deeper, because any decent journalist would easily run a background check and reach the conclusion that Roxy is not really a debutante.

No, there must be a carefully executed operation behind, where said prostitutes are hired years in advance. They are paid laser surgeries to remove their tattoos. They are sent to college. Fake documents are forged, accents are crafted through speaking and acting classes, and strings are pulled for them to have a career as actors, models, or nuclear scientists.

This is something that must take a lot of time and resources to accomplish, and I can imagine that the whole initiative is being led by Alfred.

So, when a subject is ready, she is activated, and gets to date Bruce Wayne for a few nights while the paparazzi take pictures.

I don‚Äôt even think that he has sex with them. He doesn‚Äôt strike me as that kind of guy. Though I‚Äôm not sure about Alfred.


## Solving Chess

When a game is left to the last 7 pieces, Chess is a solved problem.

The way Chess is solved is that we have calculated all the possible move sequences with any 7 pieces left, in any position on the board. So this is not an AI thing. We just know the optimal moves. Sometimes the sequences are weird and unintuitive, but it doesn't matter, because they will lead you to victory, provided that you have downloaded and committed to memory the 140 terabytes archive that lists them all


So, what if we add a piece? Can we solve chess when it's down to any last 8 pieces? Of course we can, but we need to pay around 5 million dollars per year in cloud storage.

With this in mind, can we solve Chess? Can we map all possible combination for 32 pieces, and hence be done with this sport and leave a bunch Russians out of job?

Unfortunately, it's not possible. We cannot build the flash storage that contains all the permutations because there aren't enough atoms in the Universe.

I told you we were going to run out of them!
