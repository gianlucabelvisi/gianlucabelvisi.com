So, I'm on a date, and I'm asked what my **daily routine** is, because apparently these are the kind of questions that people ask on dates.

Anyway, I provide a detailed account of my typical day, which takes me a solid **seven minutes**, because I'm thorough.

At the end of my lengthy monologue, my date is holding her head with two hands. Her elbows firmly on the table and an expression of **anguish**.

She takes a long sip at her beer, then asks me:

<Dialogue>"Where... where do you find the energy to do all that?"</Dialogue>

I allow a few seconds of silence, for effect. Then reply:

<Dialogue>"Food." ðŸ¦„</Dialogue>

And let me be clear, this is a **rude** answer on my part, which she doesn't deserve, as she is a perfectly nice and smart woman, even if she asks way too personal questions.

Now, the reasons why I'm self sabotaging my own dates are better discussed with a **professional** and are besides the point. The point is that, yes, I seem to be doing a great many things in a day that, may I remind you, only lasts 24 hours.

Here is my standard month:

![Easy if you don't sleep](march.jpg)

And this doesn't even include commuting to work to another country every day, reading [a book per week](/books-2021), and playing **Elden Ring**. This latter is the reason why I'm four books behind schedule, and I will have to compromise and start reading comics. Comics!

Anyway, my date is now asking me what am I typing on my laptop, and I tell her that I'm writing this very **blog post**. Yes, this is all happening live. My priorities are clear, which I feel she understands.

She asks:

<Dialogue>"What's your secret? I could really use some motivation." </Dialogue>

To which I promptly reply:

<Dialogue>"You do, if you are a fucking moron." ðŸ¦„</Dialogue>

And look, we have already established that my flirting skills need a tiny bit of **work**, so no use lingering on it further. Let's focus instead on the core message...

## Motivation is bad, actually

There will come a time when things will align just perfectly in your life, and as a result you will feel highly motivated.

It could be due to scoring a critical on your hormone levels. It could be a relieving post-nut clarity, or maybe you read one of those **Tim Urban** blog posts that say that you only have 4000 weeks in your life so, you know, better hurry or something.

Now, this motivated version of you is a toxic, false, unreliable version of you. You should **never**, ever trust this stranger with any important decision. If at all possible, you should slap yourself out of this state.

![Nani?](slap.jpg)

There even is a day, and infamous day, where the worst motivations tend to coalesce the most. This day is **December 31st**.

That's when human adults lie to themselves with insane prospects.

<Dialogue>
    That's it, come tomorrow, I will diet, I will exercise, I will finally start writing that novel about lesbian zombie nuns.
</Dialogue>

The tomorrow in these kinds of vows is never 24 hours from now. Everything is closed on January 1st anyway! No, this tomorrow is more of an abstract concept where all aspirations are sent to die. It's the pet cemetery of good motivations.

## Why motivation is bad

According to Newton's **third law of motion**, significant change in one's life comes with a huge spring attached. The more you stretch it, the higher the resistance you will encounter. And the kickback will send you back to square one with such a strength that you will be stuck there.

You will enter a positive feedback loop. What you wanted to achieve will seem so far away that you will resolve to sit on your sofa and watch tv. This will make you feel sluggish, so you'll watch more tv because you don't have energy to do anything else.

At some point, Netflix will stop playing whathever shitty thing you are watching and will ask if you are still awake, or maybe you're a lazy piece of shit. This leads to anxiety. Anxiety leads to junk food. Junk food to obesity. Obesity to the dark side.

<FigureLabel>Horny now.</FigureLabel>

Never put yourself in the position of feeling shame, as shame is a conservative force. It will drag you down and keep you there.

Instead, try the alternative of tiny, incremental changes.

## One percent better

Imagine yourself today. You woke up, had breakfast, showered, went to work, and so on until you pass out in bed tonight.

Let's put a value to this person. Let's give it a 1. Replace with 0.2 if you are from Naples.

Imagine you being this very same you for the whole year. How much would that be? Let me run the math for you:

<Formula>
    1<sup>365</sup> = 1
</Formula>

Ok, cool!

Now imagine doing a tiny bit more every day. Let's say 1% more. Not much, is it? Almost a rounding error. Let's do the calculation again:

<Formula>
    1.01<sup>365</sup> = 37.78
</Formula>

I think you will agree that 37.78 is significantly higher than 1.

In just a year, you have turned your life around completely, and all you had to do was do 1% more every day.

## Do you feel inspired?

Would you still feel inspired if I told you that I lied to you?

Thanks to the power of **compounding**, one percent better is actually a lot! Improve your basketball fundamentals for that amount every day, and you'll be Michael Jordan by mid april!

So it appears that I manipulated you. I could have used Religion for that, or even worse self help, but I used Math instead!

Though, the point stands. You just need to remove the compounding from the equation. You should not aspire at always improving, or you will enter another form of positive feedback, one at the end of which will have you become a hummingbird.

What you need to do is develop daily habits that will sustain you at your worst, when the motivation has left you, and all you want to do is be home eating cheese.

## goals vs systems

## Habit

* cue
* craving
* response
* reward

## 1. Make it obvious

make it automatic

<Quote title="Fancy Quote" from="Jung">
    Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate
</Quote>

"I will [stuff] at [time] o clock, in [location]"

Stack habits so that one comes naturally after the other.

You need an environment that will help you follow the habit.

Make the cue visible and the bad invisible.

Have a reading zone. Build a faraday cage and live inside it so that Tik Tok will never find you.

## 2. Make it attractive

goals do not differentiate winners from losers.

Systems focus on the person you want to become, instead of the result.

If you want to quit smoking, and someone offers you a cigarette. If you reply:

<Pony>
    "No, thank you. I'm trying to quit."
</Pony>

You are framing yourself by your struggle. You are setting yourself for failure. Trying to quit, really? Another beer and you will crawl back to me, imploring for a smoke. And at that point do you know what i will say to you. Ok.

Here is a better answer:

<Pony>
    "No, thank you. I'm not a smoker."
</Pony>

You made it about your identity. Who you are.

I personally like to go one step further and make it about who I am not:

<Pony>
    "No, thank you. I'm not a piece of shit."
</Pony>


Dopaming -- craving
-- experiencing

Temptation buildiing: need to do VS want to do

Group influence: find a culture you want to become.

Make hard habits attractive by learning to associate them to a positive experience.

Success is the product of daily habits.

Do not compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to past yourself.

## Wait, are you still on the date?

Well, yeah. Who do you think was I talking with all this time?

She's in the bathroom now, as the tears ruined her makeup. I think I stroke a cord into her.

Yeah, but I'm coming up with an excuse to leave because I just noticed a giant red flag.

I told her that I was considering getting a golden retriever and name it Renato, and she said:

<Pony>Oh, but golden retrievers are such boring dogs.</Pony>

I couldn't believe what I just heard.

<Pony>You know who's a boring dog? Your mom. Because she's a whore.</Pony>

I know, that was incredibly stupid of me. I should have said "because she's a bitch"! I had the perfect comeback on a silver plate, and I totally ruined it!

I feel like I will wake up at night all sweaty and thinking about the missed opportunity. If I had one chance to go back in time and change things, I wouldn't even kill Hitler. I would go back to tonight and change my line.

If I had two shots at time travel, still I wouldn't kill Hitler. I would buy bitcoin instead.

Now, three times? Totally Hitler. I don't care what you say, I will go back to 1945 and murder the guy.

Four times? Has to be Jesus. He just rubs me the wrong way with his effortless abs.

Five times or more? Dinosaurs all the way down.
