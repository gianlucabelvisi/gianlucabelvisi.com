So, while on a date, I'm asked what my **daily routine** is, because apparently these are the kind of questions that people ask on dates. Bit too personal in my opinion.

At any rate, I provide a detailed account of my day, which takes me a solid **seven minutes** because I'm thorough. At the end of my lengthy monologue, my date is holding her head with two hands. Her elbows firmly on the table and an expression of mental anguish.

She takes a long sip at her beer, then asks me:

<Pony>"Where... where do you find the energy to do all that?"</Pony>

I allow a few seconds of silence, for effect. Then I reply:

<Pony>"Food." ðŸ¦„</Pony>

And let me be clear, this is quite a **rude** answer on my part, which she doesn't deserve, as she is a perfectly nice woman, even if she asks way too personal questions.

Now, the reasons why I'm self sabotaging my own dates are better discussed with a **professional** and are besides the point. The point is that, yes, I seem to be doing a great many things in a day that, may I remind you, only lasts 24 hours.

Here is my standard month:

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

And this doesn't even include commuting to work to another country every day, reading [a book per week](/books-2021), playing **Elden Ring**.

My date is now asking why am I typing on my laptop, and I tell her that I'm writing this very [blog post](/developing-habits). Yes, this is all happening live because my priorities are clear, which I feel she understands.

She then asks:

<Pony>"Anyway, what's your secret? I could really use some motivation." </Pony>

To which I promptly reply:

<Pony>"You do, if you are a fucking moron." ðŸ¦„</Pony>

And look, we have already established that my flirting skills need a tiny bit of work, so no use lingering on it. Let's focus instead on the core message...

## Motivation is bad, actually



Motivated you is an arrogant, overconfident, unbearable piece of shit.

Worst day of them all. December 31st.



Are you satisfied with your life? Are you the best person that you can possibly be? When things get difficult, do you feel like you have the inner strength to overcome?

I'm pretty sure that then answer to all the above is no, and that in this very moment you are questioning your life choices.

I can tell because you are reading my blog, which means that serious mistakes were made for you to end up here.

Here's the thing: we are given limited amount of weeks in this life. Four thousand give or take.

You are probably thinking that you only have 4000 weeks in this life, and a significant amount of those weeks goes in ~~taxes~~sleep. Then there's the amount you spend on Tik-Tok, being sad, put food in your mouth until. Then I guess some weeks are kind of ok.

## One percent better

Imagine the yourself of today. You woke up, had breakfast, went to work, xxx. Let's put a value to this person. Let's give it a 1. Imagine you being this very same you for the whole year. How much would that be. Let me run the math for you...

1^365 = 1

Ok cool. At least it's not 0.2! I wouldn't want to be from Naples!

Now imagine doing a tiny bit more every day. Let's say 1% mroe. Not much, is it? Almost a round error. Let's run the math again

1.01^365 = 37.78

I think you will agree with me that 37.78 is significantly higher than 1.

In just a year, you have turned your life around completely, and all you had to do was do 1% more every day.

Don't you feel inspired?

Would you still feel inspired if I told you that I lied to you?

Thanks to the powers of compounding, 1% better every day is actually a lot! Improve your basketball fundamentals 1% every day and you are Michael Jordan by mid april.

So it appears that I manipulated you. I could have used Religion for that, or even worse Self Help. But I used Math instead.

Don't you feel motivated now? If you do, don't!

## Motivation is bad, actually

Do not trust in motivation, as it's not here to stay.

That's it, from tomorrow, I will diet/write every day/become a terrorist. The tomorrow in these kinds of sentences is never 24 hours from now. It's more of an abstract location where all aspirations are sent to die. It's the elephant cemetery of good intentions.



What you need to do is develop daily habits that will sustain you at your worst, when the motivation has left you, and all you want to do is be home eating cheese.

Shame does not lead to change.

Avoid positive feedback loops.
    Watching tv makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more tv because you don't have energy to do anything else

    Anxiety leads to junk food, junk food to obesity

You can break a bad habit, but you are unlikely to forget it.

##

Success is the product of daily habits.

Do not compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to past yourself.

When Facebook suggests you posts from 8 years ago, and after you have reabsorbed the tears as if they were snot, what do you t

## goals vs systems

goals do not differentiate winners from losers.

Systems focus on the person you want to become, instead of the result.

If you want to quit smoking, and someone offers you a cigarette. If you reply:

"No, thank you. I'm trying to quit."

You are framing yourself by your struggle. You are setting yourself for failure. Trying to quit, really? Another beer and you will crawl back to me, imploring for a smoke. And at that point do you know what i will say to you. Ok.

Here is a better answer:

"No, thank you. I'm not a smoker."

You made it about your identity. Who you are.

I personally like to go one step further and make it about who I am not:

"No, thank you. I'm not a piece of shit."

## Habit

* cue
* craving
* response
* reward

## 1. Make it obvious

make it automatic

Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate
Jung.

"I will [stuff] at [time] o clock, in [location]"

Stack habits so that one comes naturally after the other.

You need an environment that will help you follow the habit.

Make the cue visible and the bad invisible.

Have a reading zone. Build a faraday cage and live inside it so that Tik Tok will never find you.

## 2. Make it attractive

Dopaming -- craving
         -- experiencing

Temptation buildiing: need to do VS want to do

Group influence: find a culture you want to become.

Make hard habits attractive by learning to associate them to a positive experience.

Gym at 6:30

Coffee mindfulness session

Hardcore history.

## 3. Make it easy

Repetition

Reduce friction

Prime the environment for use

2 minute rule

## 4. Make it satisfying

Sauna

Reward yourself
    sauna after gym

feel succesful: complete tasks, put post its in done

Don't break the chain. Killstreak.

Acountability partners

circles closing

consume VS produce.



## Wait, are you still on the date?

Yeah, but I'm coming up with an excuse to leave because I just noticed a giant red flag.

I told her that I was considering getting a golden retriever and name it Renato, and she said:

<Pony>Oh, but golden retrievers are such boring dogs.</Pony>

I couldn't believe what I just heard.

<Pony>You know who's a boring dog? Your mom. Because she's a whore.</Pony>

I know, that was incredibly stupid of me. I should have said "because she's a bitch"! I had the perfect comeback on a silver plate, and I totally ruined it!

I feel like I will wake up at night all sweaty and thinking about the missed opportunity. If I had one chance to go back in time and change things, I wouldn't even kill Hitler. I would go back to tonight and change my line.

If I had two shots at time travel, still I wouldn't kill Hitler. I would buy bitcoin instead.

Now, three times? Totally Hitler. I don't care what you say, I will go back to 1945 and murder the guy.

Four times? Has to be Jesus. He just rubs me the wrong way with his effortless abs.

Five times or more? Dinosaurs all the way down.
