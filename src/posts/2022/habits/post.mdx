So, I'm on a date, and I'm asked what my **daily routine** is, because apparently these are the kind of questions that people ask on dates.

Anyway, I provide a detailed account of my typical day, which takes me a solid **seven minutes** because I'm thorough.

At the end of my lengthy monologue, my date is holding her head with two hands. Her elbows firmly on the table and an expression of mental anguish.

She takes a long sip at her beer, then asks me:

<Pony>"Where... where do you find the energy to do all that?"</Pony>

I allow a few seconds of silence, for effect. Then reply:

<Pony>"Food." ðŸ¦„</Pony>

And let me be clear, this is a **rude** answer on my part, which she doesn't deserve, as she is a perfectly nice woman, even if she asks way too personal questions.

Now, the reasons why I'm self sabotaging my own dates are better discussed with a **professional** and are besides the point. The point is that, yes, I seem to be doing a great many things in a day that, may I remind you, only lasts 24 hours.

Here is my standard month:

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

And this doesn't even include commuting to work to another country every day, reading [a book per week](/books-2021), playing **Elden Ring**.

My date is now asking why am I typing on my laptop, and I tell her that I'm writing this very **blog post**. Yes, this is all happening live. My priorities are clear, which I feel she understands.

She then asks:

<Pony>"Anyway, what's your secret? I could really use some motivation." </Pony>

To which I promptly reply:

<Pony>"You do, if you are a fucking moron." ðŸ¦„</Pony>

And look, we have already established that my flirting skills need a tiny bit of **work**, so no use lingering on it further. Let's focus instead on the core message...

## Motivation is bad, actually

There will come a time when things will align just perfectly in your life, and as a result you will feel a motivation spike.

It could be due to a critical dice toss on your hormone levels, it could be post-nut clarity, or maybe you read one of those **Tim Urban** blog posts that say that you only have 4000 weeks in your life so, you know, better hurry or something.

Now, this highly motivated version of you is a toxic, false, unreliable version of you. You should never, ever trust this person with any important decision, and if at all possible you should avoid putting yourself in the position of being highly motivated.

December 31st.

That's it, from tomorrow, I will diet/write every day/become a terrorist. The tomorrow in these kinds of sentences is never 24 hours from now. It's more of an abstract location where all aspirations are sent to die. It's the elephant cemetery of good intentions.


The reason.

Shame does not lead to change.

Do not trust in motivation, as it's not here to stay.

Significant change in one's life comes with a huge spring attached. The more you stretch it, the higher the resistance and the kickback.

Avoid positive feedback loops. Watching tv makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more tv because you don't have energy to do anything else

Anxiety leads to junk food, junk food to obesity

## One percent better

Imagine the yourself of today. You woke up, had breakfast, went to work, xxx. Let's put a value to this person. Let's give it a 1. Imagine you being this very same you for the whole year. How much would that be. Let me run the math for you...

<Formula>
    1<sup>365</sup> = 1
</Formula>

Ok cool. At least it's not 0.2! I wouldn't want to be from Naples!

Now imagine doing a tiny bit more every day. Let's say 1% more. Not much, is it? Almost a round error. Let's run the math again

<Formula>
    1.01<sup>365</sup> = 37.78
</Formula>

I think you will agree that 37.78 is significantly higher than 1.

In just a year, you have turned your life around completely, and all you had to do was do 1% more every day.

<Pony>
    Don't you feel inspired?
</Pony>

Would you still feel inspired if I told you that I lied to you?

Thanks to the powers of compounding, 1% better every day is actually a lot! Improve your basketball fundamentals 1% every day and you are Michael Jordan by mid april.

So it appears that I manipulated you. I could have used Religion for that, or even worse Self Help. But I used Math instead.

Don't you feel motivated now? If you do, don't!

What you need to do is develop daily habits that will sustain you at your worst, when the motivation has left you, and all you want to do is be home eating cheese.


Success is the product of daily habits.

Do not compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to past yourself.

When Facebook suggests you posts from 8 years ago, and after you have reabsorbed the tears as if they were snot, what do you t

## goals vs systems







## Habit

* cue
* craving
* response
* reward

## 1. Make it obvious

make it automatic

<Quote title="Fancy Quote" from="Jung">
    Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate
</Quote>

"I will [stuff] at [time] o clock, in [location]"

Stack habits so that one comes naturally after the other.

You need an environment that will help you follow the habit.

Make the cue visible and the bad invisible.

Have a reading zone. Build a faraday cage and live inside it so that Tik Tok will never find you.

## 2. Make it attractive

goals do not differentiate winners from losers.

Systems focus on the person you want to become, instead of the result.

If you want to quit smoking, and someone offers you a cigarette. If you reply:

<Pony>
    "No, thank you. I'm trying to quit."
</Pony>

You are framing yourself by your struggle. You are setting yourself for failure. Trying to quit, really? Another beer and you will crawl back to me, imploring for a smoke. And at that point do you know what i will say to you. Ok.

Here is a better answer:

<Pony>
    "No, thank you. I'm not a smoker."
</Pony>

You made it about your identity. Who you are.

I personally like to go one step further and make it about who I am not:

<Pony>
    "No, thank you. I'm not a piece of shit."
</Pony>


Dopaming -- craving
-- experiencing

Temptation buildiing: need to do VS want to do

Group influence: find a culture you want to become.

Make hard habits attractive by learning to associate them to a positive experience.

Gym at 6:30

Coffee mindfulness session

Hardcore history.

## 3. Make it easy

Repetition

Reduce friction

Prime the environment for use

2 minute rule

## 4. Make it satisfying

Sauna

Reward yourself
sauna after gym

feel succesful: complete tasks, put post its in done

Don't break the chain. Killstreak.

Acountability partners

circles closing


You can break a bad habit, but you are unlikely to forget it.



## Wait, are you still on the date?

Well, yeah. Who do you think was I talking with all this time?

She's in the bathroom now, as the tears ruined her makeup. I think I stroke a cord into her.

Yeah, but I'm coming up with an excuse to leave because I just noticed a giant red flag.

I told her that I was considering getting a golden retriever and name it Renato, and she said:

<Pony>Oh, but golden retrievers are such boring dogs.</Pony>

I couldn't believe what I just heard.

<Pony>You know who's a boring dog? Your mom. Because she's a whore.</Pony>

I know, that was incredibly stupid of me. I should have said "because she's a bitch"! I had the perfect comeback on a silver plate, and I totally ruined it!

I feel like I will wake up at night all sweaty and thinking about the missed opportunity. If I had one chance to go back in time and change things, I wouldn't even kill Hitler. I would go back to tonight and change my line.

If I had two shots at time travel, still I wouldn't kill Hitler. I would buy bitcoin instead.

Now, three times? Totally Hitler. I don't care what you say, I will go back to 1945 and murder the guy.

Four times? Has to be Jesus. He just rubs me the wrong way with his effortless abs.

Five times or more? Dinosaurs all the way down.
