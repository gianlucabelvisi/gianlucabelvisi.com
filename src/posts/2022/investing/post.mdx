Before we get into the meat of the matter, would you kindly answer the following poll?

<Poll id="investing-2021"
      question="Do you invest your savings in the stock market?"
      answers={["Yes, of course", "No, actually", "Lol, what savings?"]}
      labels={["Yes", "No, I'm dumb", "I'm broke ðŸ™ˆ"]}
/>

Interesting results, right?

Well, I actually wouldn't know, because I'm writing from the past and the poll has not been published yet. I didn't really think this through.
