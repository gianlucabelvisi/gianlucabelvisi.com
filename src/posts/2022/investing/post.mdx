Before we get into the meat of the matter, would you kindly answer the following poll? It will inform the rest of the post...

<Poll id="investing-2021"
      question="Do you invest your savings in the stock market?"
      answers={["Yes, of course", "No, actually", "Lol, what savings?"]}
      labels={["Yes", "No, I'm dumb", "I'm broke ðŸ™ˆ"]}
/>

Interesting results, don't you think?

Well, I actually wouldn't know, because I'm writing from the past and the poll has not been published yet. I didn't really think this through!

Anyway, if you have savings and are not investing them in any way, shape or form, congratulations. You are losing money to inflation. If you leave in the US, you have lost 7% of that money, and this is only in 2021!

My main quest is simple: get to 1 MILLION DOLLARS.

My subquest is more challenging: beat every year the average gains of the S&P 500, which is around 10%.

## Wait, what's the S&P 500?

The S&P 500 is a weighted ind that collects the 500 best companies of the United States. This is the Apples, the Amazons

(Why not a European index? Europe is economically dead.)

## So how did I do?

Before I get to this year's result, I want to remind you that, [last year](/inveting-2020) I ended up with an astonishing +84%, which is frankly the result of luck carefully pondered investing strategies.

Thank you! I'm really happy with the results. It's not as incredible as +84%, but it's still really good! Out of pure curiosity, how much did the S&P 500 do this year?

<ProfitBox subject={"The S&P 500"} percentage={29}/>

Well, fuck me.

I could have sold everything and go all in with Microsoft

## Vaccine companies

There was a moment in early 2021 when we thought that the whole pandemic was done. As a result, vaccine companies like Moderna and Pfizer went through a selloff. I took the opportunity to load on both. Then a bunch of variants came and we were all like we need vaccines still.

Then, Pfizer and Moderna raised in price. Moderna tripled, actually, and I thought it was too much and I sold it, getting some well earned gains.

Now, selling Moderna was a great choice, as it then went back to a shit price.

I haven't sold Pfizer though. It's just not a one trick pony. They are developing a pill that you get when you feel covid symptoms.

Plus they have the rights for Rapamacyn, a molecule that seems to be tied to longevity.

Plus, they have the dick pills.
