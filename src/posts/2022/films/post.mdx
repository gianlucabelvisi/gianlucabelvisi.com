Movies. Am I right?

2022 has to have been the worst year for movies, what with the pandemic still pulling our sleeve, most of the greatest directors being dead for at least two decades, and **Will Smith** punching people into submission.

We seem to have stopped going to the cinema, and when we do, it has to be justified, like a film of action figures beating each other up or extremely **sexy** people dealing with worms.

Can you imagine watching an **art film** in a theater in 2022 of all years? Picture yourself being at home, naked, and then getting the idea that, yes, I should put clothes on to go outside and watch a film about people sitting at home talking.

If you are trying to impress a date, there are less dishonest ways.


Now, I like series as much as the next person, but I have to say I can see the value of witnessing a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, that effs off in two hours, instead of having me hostage for eight seasons, more than 100 hours, to build a complex texture of characters in a mild fantasy setting, and then finally have your main protagonist go and burn a town in Croatia out of a character growth study based on "bitches be crazy".

## Titane

Julia Ducournau is the insane mind behind [Raw](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4954522/?ref_=nm_knf_i2), my favorite film for when I'm fasting.

<FigureLabel>Fun fact, I eat eight chicken breasts per week</FigureLabel>

So I was super eager to see her latest work Titane, which by the way won the **Palme D'Or**. The trailer is interestingly weirdzzz...

I'll watch it and get back to you.

Ok, what the f did I just watch?

The trailer lied to me! I was expecting weird people vibing, and I get sex with cars, serial killing, steroids. Loved it!

What Julia Ducournau is doing with her body in this film will stick with me for a while.

## Swan song

Did you know that **Apple** not only makes phones, computers, doctors repellent fruit, but also movies?

Black mirror, so you are best enjoying it if you know nothing about the story, which is way I'm not embedding a trailer. I just don't trust you not to watch it.

Mahershala Ali is magnificent.

I don't think this film is particularly good, which is a disappointment to me, as I love the cast.

Now, the reasons why this film is not particularly good are fascinating to me, and make the whole experience worthwhile.

I would like to be able to say more, but this is a super complex conversation to have, and I don't think I have the skills to have it.

                By the way, I watched <strong>The Batman</strong> and I thought that this movie was very long!
            </p>
            <p>
                You can blame the complexity of the story, the multiple villains, the chase sequences, but I believe the main reason for a 3 hours film is that Batman moves really slowly!

        He will enter a room, lethargically look around, and then slowly walk toward center camera, while I', like, motherfucker, can we speed up? I have to wake up early!
    </p>

        Also, it was very interesting how Batman has a car, and it's just a car. Like, there is nothing special to this car, except maybe some extra swagger but not too much. Kinda like Mexican Batman but not Sicilian Batman as one would expect.

## The French Dispatch

Plus, Léa Seydoux is naked for most of the time.

## The Green Knight

When [A24](https://a24films.com/) releases a new film, you just have to watch it, otherwise you risk missing out on some of the best, weirdest gems out there, like Under the skin, Locke, Ex Machina, The Lobster, The Witch, Swiss Army Man.

The Green Knight is yet another of those.

Based on a poem within the Arthurian Literary Universe, the film follows Gawain's quest very closely. Though, while the poem delivers the classic hero's journey, the film does the same while also commenting on the fact that heroes' journeys are kind of silly.

This results in a completely reinvented ending that makes the whole operation stick the lading. The final line for the titular Knight are chef kiss. Also, every shot is absolutely gorgeous.

## The worst person in the world

Is Joachim Trier related to Lars Von?

## Pig

Nicolas Cage does two kind of films:

* Wet farts he can pay up debt with

* Absolute masterpieces he can pay up debt with

So, which one is it with Pig? Let's give it a watch...

Well, it's the latter.

I would have expected the Venn diagram between me and a hermit looking for his kidnapped truffle pig to be boobs, instead it's the mastercard symbol.
