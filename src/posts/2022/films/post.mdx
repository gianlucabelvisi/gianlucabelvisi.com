Movies. Am I right?

2022 has to be the worst year for movies, what with a pandemic in the rearview mirror.

And when we go to the cinema, it has to be an event, like a film of action figures beating each other up or really sexy people dealing with outdoors sand worms.

Can you imagine watching an art move in a cinema in 2022 of all years? Picture yourself being at home, naked, and the getting the idea that, yes, I should put clothes on to go to the cinema and watch a film about people sitting at home talking.

If you are trying to impress a date, there are less dishonest ways.

And these days people binge-watch series anyway.

Now, I like series as much as the next person, but I have to say I can see the value of witnessing a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, that effs off in two hours, instead of having me hostage for eight seasons, more than 100 hours, to build a complex texture of characters in a mild fantasy setting, and then finally have your main protagonist go and burn a town in Croatia out of a character growth study based on "bitches be crazy".
