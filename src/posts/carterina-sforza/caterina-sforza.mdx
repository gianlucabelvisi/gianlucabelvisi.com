Do you ever miss Game of Thrones, with all its political machinations and incest? Well, stop hurting yourself re-watching the latest seasons, and read about the Italian Renaissance instead! It's got similar tropes, but significantly fewer dragons ex machina.

Set between the 14th and 15th century, Renaissance Italy was a sort of Westeros, divided into states led by powerful families, like the Aragons in Naples, the Pope in Rome, the Medici in Florence, the Borgias in Milan, and stench of rotten fish in Venice.

The period was saturated with such incredible characters, like Lorenzo de Medici, also called The Magnificent, probably by himself; or the polymath Leonardo da Vinci, the scheming Niccolo' Machiavelli, the Shakespearean Lucrezia Borgia. Though my favorite is by far Caterina Sforza.

Coming from a family that got promoted to nobility thanks to their fighting prowess, Caterina was a mix of the two Stark sisters: humble but cunning when circumstances allowed for it, and absolute freaking badass when push came to shove.

For instance, in 1488 Caterina was defending the castle of Ravaldino, in Forli', which was sieged by her enemies, the Orsis. To try and break the stalemate, the Orsis brought Caterina's young children in front of the fortress and threatened to slit their throats had Caterina not opened the gates.

Well, legend says that Caterina went on the ramparts and yelled: "Go ahead and do it, you fools!" then she raised her skirt. "I have the means to make others!"

That's when she got the nickname The Tigress of Forli', which is also the title of a book on her life that I thoroughly enjoyed. Best read with a map of Italy on your lap as if it was Middle-earth. The dwarves are the Sardinians.

This is her portrayed by Botticelli as someone who, despite being uber pregnant, gets shit done, which is quintessential Caterina.
