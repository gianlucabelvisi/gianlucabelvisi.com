My three favorite jokes ever.
(don't know the authors, rewrote them to be more concise.)

#3
A cop pulls over a car. The driver is quantum physicist Werner Heisenberg.
"Sir," the cop asks. "Do you know how fast you were going?"
"No, but I know exactly where I am!"

#2
At the stadium during the World Cup's final, a man notices that the seat next to his neighbor is empty.
"Weird," he tells the neighbor. "Who buys a ticket to the World Cup's final and then doesn't show up?"
"Ah, that would be my wife. We planned this dream holiday to see the World Cup a few years back, but then she sadly passed away."
"I'm... I'm so sorry! This must be terrible! Are you ok? Shouldn't  a friend or a relative be with you today?"
"I wish, but they all are at the funeral."

#1
Two British nuns are riding their bicycles around Vatican City.
"Wow," says one. "I never came this way before."
"Yeah, I know. It's the cobblestones."
