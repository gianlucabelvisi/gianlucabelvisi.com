This happened.

I'm in Germany for work, enjoying the gym at the Hilton hotel of Gendarmenmarkt because this is something that, in post-war Germany, you can totally do.

After the workout, I notice that the gym also has a naked spa, even though they prefer the term textile free area of relaxation and mindfulness. Germans.

Anyway, I suddenly feel like you know what I should go to the naked spa. I deserve it. 2019 has been a shitty year!

So I undress and head toward the naked enclosure. The no man's land for clothes. The event horizon of anything textile. I bleep the card against the door - don't ask me where I kept the card - and enter a large, warm, elegantly tiled room. A few frames in, I ask myself the following question: did I just enter the women's naked spa?

With this horrifying realization, I squeal and pull the clutch to do a hasty 180. Too quick in retrospect, because the slippery floor overcorrects it to a 360, sending me back to squeal one, while my penis is absorbing the momentum energy via a pendulum-like movement that everybody is gazing at.

I don't know if there is such a thing as a five seconds rule for being naked in a place we are not supposed to be naked in, but it seems reasonable to assume so. So I squeal again and moonwalk away from the place. I now know that I have to leave the premises, if not the country, as I am - naked - before somebody gets the chance of calling the german version of 911. Nein-ein-ein.

Then I notice the stick figures on the sign at the entrance: a slender human shape clearly symbolizing a naked athletic woman and... hum... is that a Scottish guy? It doesn't take me much more to understand that it's not the women's naked spa I just entered. It's the mixed naked spa! Where all sexes and genders can happily exist as peers, enjoying the steam, the icy poodles, their nakedness, as a pre original sin Garden of Eden. In Germany of all places!

I suddenly feel like you know what I should go to the mixed naked spa. I deserve it. I can't stress enough how shitty 2019 was!

I get back to the Garden of Eden with my po-po-poker face, trusting that nobody would realize that I am the same squeal-y pendulum-penised person that stormed out not thirty seconds before.

So there I am, naked, in this big hub room where everybody is just chilling, like in one of those mangas for perverts, also called mangas. I'm feeling like my Stendhal Syndrome is about to kick in, because everyone is extremely beautiful, except for that guy. So I brainstorm that my best path of action is to reduce the visual stimuli by going to the hammam, with its high steamy Silent Hill content.

The hammam is a small, misty, oval room that is jam-packed with naked humans sitting their backs against the wall, looking at each other like a Council of Elrond of naked middle-earth.

They all have to squeeze a bit to make space for me.

I realize I'm not ready for this level of intimacy. This is happening way too fast for my culture shock to keep up.

People are chatting in German, but kindly switch to English once they get wind that I do not speak the black speech. They ask me what I thought of the early Christmas decorations. I reply that we should probably pull in a favor from the eagles and be done with it.

I know that I must not make eye contact because, according to Heisenberg's principle, it's only when people look at you in the eyes that they realize that you are naked. So I blur my view as if watching one of those pictures with hidden shapes, and keep my eye-sight below the horizon so not to risk crossing the streams.

So there I am, sweating like a pig in a steamy room, with blurry wide open eyes, and looking way south of the border where, fun fact, genitals tend to coalesce. All good traits of a Major Perv, which is probably why everybody leaves within minutes.

All in all, I consider my first experience in a mixed naked spa an outstanding success!

Then on my way out, I entered the women's changing room by mistake.
