This website has release notes. It's a thing I do.

## How to read a version

A version comprises three numbers: major.minor.patch

* *Major*: used for big updates. Not necessarily breaking changes, but something that you should notice. A redesign. A new section maybe.
* *Minor*: some tinier details that you shouldn't probably mind too much
* *Patch*: bug fixes or minor visual improvements
